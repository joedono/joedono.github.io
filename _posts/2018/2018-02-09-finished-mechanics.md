Sorry that I'm going to make all my readers download a 6MB gif in this post. This is the first time I tried using ScreenToGif to capture some game footage and the default 15fps looked absolutely terrible, and 30fps generated this monster. This is, by far, one of the coolest title screens I've ever build. They're usually nothing more than a simple image, but this one has *animation*!!

I've finished building all the basic mechanics in this game. It has a full game loop now with all the trappings I wanted to put in. I still don't have a win condition, but Jaws cannot win in the movie either. No matter how many times you watch the movie, the shark always loses :P. There's no difficulty ramp up, but I'm not sure if I'll have enough time for that. I still have today and the weekend, so we'll see how much polish I can add after playtesting and balancing tweaks. I also need to either add more sounds or take away the gunshot sound. I playtested it a bit after making the hunters actually hunt you and the gunshot sound gave me a jumpscare. I'm really excited about this jam. It's hosted by small-time Let's Players on YouTube who are promising to showcase the games in their videos if we like. It'll be the first time I've had a stranger try out my game and give their honest opinion.

I already mentioned that I'm going to take a break from development after this project. I'm going to try devoting that time to leveling up my art skill. If I can get to the point where I can create decent looking assets quickly, going back to Bump on the Night will be much better. I'll be able to at least give the game a more unified art style.
