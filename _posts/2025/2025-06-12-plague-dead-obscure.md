I've definitely completely turned over the games I've been playing since I last posted.

### A Plague's Tale: Innocence
I usually try to have at least one single-player narrative game going at a time. I had this on my to-play list after Baldur's Gate, but it stayed there for a long time while I played Deep Rock Galactic, Final Fantasy XIV, and Helldivers 2. I've basically retired from all of those, so I was finally able to finish this.

I consider it to be The Last of Us if it was made with 60% of the budget. It's 1/3 the length, 1/3 the characters, and 1/3 the memorability. Now, to be fair, 1/3 of The Last of Us still makes for a good game. I enjoyed playing it and the mechanics and setting were intriguing. The only thing I didn't particularly like was the narrative disconnect between what the main character was forced to do and the reactions of the other characters. In A Plague's Tale, the major hazards are diseased rats and guards from the Inquisition. Over the course of the game, you will kill MANY members of the Inquisition, some with your rocks and sling, and some more gruesomely by trapping them with rats that devour them. During your first fight with a guard, Amecia, the main character, cries over and over how she doesn't want to fight. When you finally take the guard down, Amecia is completely broken over taking her first life. I would have expected other characters to react more negatively to Amecia revealing over the course of the game how much of a cold-blooded killer she eventually turns into, but there's nothing. I expected her 5-year-old brother to run away from her in fear multiple times, but he never reacted to all the killing she did.

Other than that, a solid title.

### Balatro
Balatro has become a problem... I fell into the trap of sitting with it for 10 minutes, which quickly turned into sitting with it for 6 hours. I am utterly in love with this game. It has the right depth of mechanics to keep me coming back over and over again. I am starting to lose interest now that I've unlocked all but the hardest things to unlock, but I keep finding time to go back to it. I think the biggest problem I'm having now is, because I can recognize when a run is failing much earlier, I'm much more prone to restarting earlier rather than trying to salvage the run. This is especially true now that the last Joker I have to unlock requires me to score 100,000,000 chips in a single hand, and there are only a handful of builds that can accomplish this.

Maybe I'll go back to the earlier stakes on the decks I've been neglecting and get through those. Or do some of the other challenges.

### Slime Rancher 2
I didn't realize this was still in Early Access when I bought it. I also didn't realize how long Slime Rancher 1 was in EA before I bought it. The only other EA game I ever bought was Subnautica, and that was already near completion. I'm a little nervous about this one, but it's proving to be a good game for when I actually want to turn my brain off. And now my son wants to have a Slime Rancher themed birthday party.

### Haste: Broken Worlds
Now this was a fun romp. I haven't played much Sonic the Hedgehog, but I think this nailed what 3D Sonic gameplay should feel like. It's a simple enough game. Get to the end of the level before the end of the world catches up with you, and there are some rogue-like elements with the randomly stocked item shop. This game is still super fun even though I've basically played it to death at this point.

### Fallen London
I'm still into this. So much so that I now have a custom decal on my car from it. A lot of that was me finally getting serious about completing the Great Hellbound Railway, and some of it now is hype over the upcoming TTRPG system. Since I got into the kickstarter early, I actually got an email from Magpie Games asking if I had a group that would be willing to sign up to beta test the system. My group is incredibly excited to try this and I'm excited to bring this world to more people.

### Deadlock
Another EA game I got into, and my very first MOBA. There's something special about getting into a game on the ground floor. No one knows how anything works, no one expects great things from anyone, and everyone is learning. The playtest for this is invitation only and the mechanics are constantly being overhauled. But I am nearly as addicted to this as I was to Team Fortress 2 back in the day, and that still has the record for the most number of hours played out of any game in my Steam library. I've found my characters (Kelvin, Paradox, and Wraith) and I'm gradually expanding (Gray Talon and Shiv). I play this every Sunday with my friends, and have scattered unplanned playtime during the week. It's amazing and I love it.

### Obscur Expedition 33
I'm only about 10 minutes into this one, but it's become my next single-player game to focus on. It's been all over TikTok, and I already know I love the soundtrack. I haven't played a full turn-based RPG without a tactical element in a long time. I haven't found nearly enough time to actually sit an play this. Most of my time winds up going to Haste and Deadlock. But I REALLY want to get into this. I'm already intrigued by the world and the despair that comes with living in a world where no one lives past the age of 33. Paris has been warped in a very interesting way. I can't wait for the story to really kick off.
