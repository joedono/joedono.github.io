In the spirit of the quarantine, I've attempted to pick up several things in order to stay occupied. My problem now is that I don't seem to have enough time or motivation to work on all of them.

1. I restarted development on Bump in the Night, resigning myself to doing my own art only to find out that my drawing tablet is old and broken.
2. I picked up the piano again, but have been losing motivation to practice since I'm nearing the end of my book and will have to find something else to play.
3. I started a new sketch of the Alien. I keep bringing my sketchbook with me around the house, but hardly ever open it to work on the drawing.
4. I got some ideas for enhancing the Alphabet Bounce game I'm working on for my son, but I never find the time to open it up and work on it.
5. I've been trying to work out more, but have completely lost the motivation to do that after hurting my back.
6. I've been reading through the Alien RPG rulebook. That one I'm actually doing from time to time.
7. I'm learning Vue (ish)
8. I'm learning Godot (ish)
9. I started a prototype site to work on the redesign of the AB website
10. The granddaddy of them all, I'm still playing FFXIV

I'm certain that all I really have to do to actually accomplish more of this stuff is to stop browsing Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube and limit the amount of time I spend playing FFXIV. I've already started telling myself that I won't really miss anything if I stop playing every morning. I don't **have** to spend every day playing video games. But then, I've also been telling myself that I don't **have** to be productive every day either, aside from working professionally, that is.

Now that I've listed everything out, I can see what I really want to work on.

1. I want to finish my sketch of the Alien
2. I want to keep playing piano
3. I want to work on Bump in the Night
4. I want to work on Alphabet Bounce
5. I want to keep playing FFXIV

There, list cut in half. That should be much more manageable for now, even though only two of them can actually be "finished." So that's what I'll keep doing. I'm going to refactor Alphabet Bounce to stop using the physics engine so I have tighter control over the player, I'm going to buy a new drawing tablet so I can work on the art for Bump in the Night, I'm going to finish my sketch, I'm going to hunt around the internet for sheet music that I can have my wife print off so I have things to learn after I'm done with my book, and I'm going to keep playing FFXIV until I max out all the job levels.

There, done.
