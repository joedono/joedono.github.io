title: Dark Souls 3 Connections
category: gaming

So I was right about not knowing enough about the bosses in Dark Souls 3 to say whether they did or did not have enough connections between them. I've watched a few of VaatiVidya's videos and discovered a few links that just aren't as obvious as familial ties or servititude. Also, the game is newer, so new connections are still being discovered.

Sulyvann is supposedly the first scholar who convinced the twin princes not to link the fire. He also stole the Profaned Flame from Yhorm to infuse it into his sword and his more trusted priests (and the dancer). Yhorm is a decendend of Wolnir, the great conquerer. Wolnir was a mighty but paranoid conquerer whose city was corrupted by the Abyss. The Abyss Watchers destroyed the city in their last crusade against the Abyss before being corrupted themselves.

So there's a few more links to add to the chain. Hopefully more will spring up as I peruse through lore wikis and videos.
