I'm not sure about this idea anymore. It might just be that I'm getting burnt out on game development again, but I'd apparently rather not be working on my project for Movie Jam. The design just doesn't feel concrete enough and I don't actually think I can make the concept fun. I've got a beach with moving waves, a shark for the player, swimmers to eat, and smaller sharks that will compete with you for food. Well, they won't compete with you yet. They just swim around forever. I still have to make them go after your kills and leave after a little while.

The problem is the hunters. I've been trying to figure out how their hunting is supposed to work. I suppose I've landed on the idea that they'll immediately move towards any blood pools from your kills, and they'll shoot at the first shark they encounter in the blood zone. Once they kill a shark, they'll leave and won't come back until your attention gauge goes up again. I already know what the answer is. I just have to stop worrying about it and code it.

I just alleviated my other problem. I had thought the jam ended this week sometime. Turns out it lasts until Monday the 12th. I still have a whole weekend to finish this up. If I can get the hunters working and the balance tweaked by Saturday afternoon, I'll be in really good shape to submit this for judging. After that, I'm going to take a break from game development for a little while. I'm at a good stopping point in Bump in the Night. The vampire scenario is done with the small exception of making the player change facing direction when they're frozen and the player tries to move. My Trello board has that covered so I should be able to just pick it up again in a couple weeks or months.

So yeah. I started looking for boat images to use for the hunters. Now I just have to actually add one to the game folder and then start coding their behavior.
