I bought Tabletop Simulator earlier this year so I could participate in GenCon Online. I used it for the serial killer escape game and Red Dragon Inn. I thought it was a cool engine, and probably is making a lot of money during this pandemic. I installed and uninstalled it a couple of times, mostly to muse over what could be. I never explored that much. I mean, I knew that it was hooked up to the Steam Workshop, but I thought that only meant people were creating and uploading their own games. I thought that the more "professional" games would be through the game's catalog and cost as much money as a full game.

Hoh boy was I wrong. On a whim, I decided to look through the workshop to see if there was anything interesting, and people in the community had actually uploaded ALL my favorite games!! Almost immediately, I went to my friends and set up a gaming night for this Friday to play Here to Slay, a game by Teeturtle that I've recently fallen in love with, despite only playing it once. I can't wait! And I can't wait for the next event I put on with this.

This weekend is going to be a helluva packed gaming weekend. I have my Tabletop Simulator meetup on Friday, Rime of the Frost Maiden on Saturday, and House of Z on Sunday. My party is reaching the end of this arc of the campaign, which means I have to be ready with a few new hooks to lead them into the next leg of the adventure. I have a good number of hooks that I can throw at them right away, but the one I **really** want to do depends on one of my players remembering that he has some unfinished business to attend to. I'll have to make sure I'm dropping more hints during the final session of this arc to remind him.
