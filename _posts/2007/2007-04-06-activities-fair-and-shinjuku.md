I've added more pictures to my album. I've also created a subfolder for all old pictures. If I've already uploaded a picture when I go to upload more, it'll go to the Old Pictures Folder.

Today was the final day of the activities fair. They really go all out with this thing. I watched the modern dance performance in the central square of campus. They really meant modern dance, it was all hip-hop and breakdance, as the pictures show. They were incredible. I'll have to see if they do a show during the semester.

I finally found the room for the smaller ballroom dance club. It only has three guys. I got a good amount of Japanese practice in, which I discovered is really easy. Most of the students are really eager to help you practice your Japanese if you are willing to help them with their English. They did a quick demo for me (cha-cha, waltz, and tango i think) and served me snacks and drinks. Now, brace yourselves cause this is the weirdest part. I found out that one of the members is going to participate in Sophia's foreign exchange program, and SHE'S COMING TO FAIRIFELD UNIV. IN AUGUST. What are the odds of that happening? I cleaned out my wallet yesterday or I would have shown her my ID. I really look forward to showing this club what I can do.

Afterward, I toured campus a bit and found the sports fields. They're all next to eachother and are overlooked by a cherry-blossom lined road around the hill. It's like a photographer's dream. It was also the place where all the clubs held their hanabi, or cherry-blossom viewing picnics. I tagged along with the Strolling (as in walking) club and participated in their hanabi. I almost got more practice than my brain could handle. It was amazing.

I stuck with the same foreign students afterward and we decided to tour Shinjuku, which is where the rest of the pictures come from. Definitely the best thing we saw was the temple. I walked through the red archway (you'll forgive me if I don't know what it's actually called) and I felt like I should take my shoes off or something. We also saw a 20-story building completely devoted to karaoke. How excessive can you get? We decided before coming to Shinjuku that we only wanted a bare-bones tour of the area around the station, so we didn't go in anywhere, but we promised ourselves that we'd come back during the day and do something. The days just keep getting better.
