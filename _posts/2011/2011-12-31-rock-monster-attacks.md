It's not perfect, but the Rock Monster is moving and killing.

It's hard to tell, but the Rock Monster is targeting the Player and trying to drop on top of them.

Dropping on the floor causes its friends to fall from the ceiling.

And killing it rewrites the layout of the room so that you can proceed.

So now I have a working boss fight. Hooray!!

Once you finish off the Rock Monster, one of the next rooms has your new weapon in it: A Flamethrower (especially good against plants). You will be able to use the flamethrower to gain access to the next area, the Plains. My next task will be to build the platforms and transition points for the plains. Then I'll go back and add textures to the Cave area.
