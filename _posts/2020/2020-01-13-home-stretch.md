Signature moves for Sia Malak are done, and Items are half done. It's coming along great!

I received a followup email from the Weave folks about Iron & Salt. They just want me to fill in a few things and then we'll be ready to start talking about contracts!

They want me to:
1. Fill in the minor gaps where I wrote a weapon with no mechanic. All I've been able to find on that is the Basic Hunting Kit.
2. Fill in the character sheets for my NPCs. Since most of them are designed to be red shirts, that should be pretty easy.

So, I took around 6 hours today and filled in the rough draft for every NPC in my set. There are 4-5 with special talents: a detective, a psychic, a medium, a witch, and a werewolf come to mind. The rest are cannon fodder or potential witnesses with limited backstories. That's actually where I'm having the most trouble, separating their Description into their Backstory, or writing all new backstories that don't repeat what they have in their description. Since I originally wrote each NPC to be their name plus their occupation, I made the decision to move their occupation into their first backstory. That's proving to be a decent guideline, but sometimes very difficult to follow when their entire description just describes their occupation. Either way, I'm done with the first draft of the NPC character sheets and I've updated my template project to include the new files for NPC sheets.

I'm really excited to hear what people have to say about this set, other than the people I've had playtest it so far. The holidays brought a ton of people to the Discord server, but I think the activity is waning. To be fair, I haven't contributed very much to it either. I've been too focused on lurking. A couple people did come on and bad mouth the system a bit, which made me sad. They're right though. The two most common complaints are lack of guidance for the storyteller, and the "why do we need this system at all?" questions. I dunno. I understand that Weave is a very lightweight system. It's meant to be high improv and demands a great degree of on-the-fly balancing from the storyteller, which not everyone is super prepared for, especially if they come from a very numerical system like D&D, where there are highly detailed tools out there for designing balanced encounters. I definitely do a lot of fudging of numbers behind my screen when I run these sorts of games. If I think the players won't make it out of an encounter they're supposed to win, I'll push them to the brink, then have the boss die in one more hit. I really don't know. I've never been able to peak behind the screen of other DMs, and I'm only just now getting to know other DMs, so I haven't had a chance to ask them questions about how they handle certain situations.

At the same time, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. In my professional life, I always feel some sense of wrongness when I learn something on my own. I never feel like it's the "right" way to do something. But with DMing, I never feel that way. Maybe I haven't reached the stage of being an "experienced" DM yet. About the only time I felt like I did something wrong in any sort of tabletop scenario was when I leveled up the character I've been using for Adventurer's League without actually earning it. But then, those are all a series of one-shots anyway and I'm not going to play in them often enough to actually progress my character.

I'm pretty sure I basically volunteered myself into a weekly Weave game thinking it would be a one-shot tonight....
