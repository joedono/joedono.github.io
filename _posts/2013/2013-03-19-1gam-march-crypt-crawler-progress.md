So...the game's pretty much done.

Well, not really. MY part is as done as I had set out in the beginning of this month. I have 5 fully functional levels, 5 types of enemies, health items, keys and locked doors, decent effects...wow. I didn't think I would be anywhere near this far at this point in the month. Here are some screenshots of the game as it stands now.

So, mechanically, the game is pretty much complete. Unfortunately, it is completely full of programmer art. I tried my hand at drawing the enemy spawning sprites (as you saw in the last post) and animating some effects. But it just doesn't look that good. So, I've brought in an artist. It's interesting integrating someone else into my workflow, especially when I have so little left to do in terms of major features. It feels a little weird pushing "all" the remaining work onto the artist. I almost don't want to add any more features for fear of just loading more work onto someone else and pushing past the deadline. We threw around the idea of a boss level, but I'm hesitant to put that much work into a feature I didn't plan from the outset.

In spite of that, I am extremely excited about this. This is shaping up to be my best game yet (especially since this is just a clone of an older game).
