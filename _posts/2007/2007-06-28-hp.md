So...today...kinda unexpectedly...we went to the World Premier of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!! We didn't actually get to see the movie, being the world premier and all, but we did get to see Daniel Radcliffe (aka Harry Potter) and the producer of the movie, in person. I couldn't get any good pictures, mostly because all I had was my cell phone, but also, the screaming fangirls made it hard to get a good shot. We did get to hear him speak though. They even gave him a script of Japanese things to say, which he did, in a typical foreigner accent. It was quite hilarious, and the crowd ate it up. We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see the movie ourselves, but I got to see the star...in person!!!
