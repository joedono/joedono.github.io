title: Game Shop Done
---
I'm pretty sure that I'm done with the [Dandy Game Shop](/Dandy-Game-Shop). It was a good learning experience in how to build an AngularJS site. I have a catalog of games, title search, a shopping cart, a game details view, a checkout, and my normal "Sorry" receipt page telling the user that their experience was faked.

I already have an idea for my next site. I happened upon a Reddit thread about free APIs and found one by Weather Underground that gets you forecast data. I'm going to make a simple but pretty page that will show the weather forecast. This will get me used to using an API I have no control over.
