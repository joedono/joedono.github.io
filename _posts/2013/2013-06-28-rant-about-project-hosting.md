I had thought that Google Code had it all. Sure, the interface was a little shoddy. But the fact that you had one place to host your version controlled source code (which could support Mercurial, Git, or Subversion) and another where you could host downloads for the distributable of your project made it the best free total project hosting solution I had ever seen. I couldn't understand why you would choose GitHub or BitBucket over them and be locked into one version control software and be responsible for your own distribution.<div><br></div><div>Well, Google has done it again. They've taken a service that doesn't fit with their "normal" business model and discontinued it. First it was Google Reader, which will be totally shut down after this weekend. Now, they've started taking down the downloadable piece of Google Code. I can see where they're coming from. The ease of use means ease of abuse. However, now that they've gotten rid of the only thing that made hem better then the other guys, this humble developer is making the jump to GitHub. Lets see how this works out. I've been meaning to learn Git anyway...
