# Class Tutorial - Machinist

This guide was written for patch 5.3

Machinist is a ranged DPS class. This means a couple of things:
1. You are ranged and usually stay away from enemies
2. You are able to move and jump about as much as you like without interrupting your abilities
3. You don't have to manage MP

For Role Actions:
1. Required - `Head Graze`
2. Highly Recommended - `Second Wind`, `Peloton`
3. Optional - `Arm's Length`

Machinist revolves around three concepts:
1. Building your Heat Gauge through combos
2. Squeezing as many attacks into the `Wildfire` duration as possible
3. Building your Battery Gauge to use `Automaton Queen`

All in all, Machinist is an exceedingly simple class, with few things to keep track of, no timer to keep refreshing, and only a handful of important abilities. You can think of Machinist abilities as being in a priority list. You just use the highest thing on the list that's not on cooldown.

## Heat Gauge
Your basic combo abilities, `Heated Split Shot`, `Heated Slug Shot`, and `Heated Clean Shot`, will build your Heat Gauge slowly. The buff, `Barrel Stabilizer`, will immediately add 50 to your Heat Gauge. When your Heat Gauge is 50 or higher, you can spend 50 from the gauge to activate `Hyperdrive` and become Overheated.

The majority of your damage comes from being in this Overheated state. This unlocks the `Heat Blast` ability, which has a couple interesting traits:
1. `Heat Blast` has a recast time of 1.5 seconds, instead of the standard 2.5 seconds on other abilities.
2. Using `Heat Blast` will reduce the cooldown timers of `Gauss Round` and `Ricochet` by 15 seconds (or half their normal cooldown time)

So, in order to squeeze the most damage out of your Overdrive status, you would activate it, and then alternate using your abilities like so:
1. `Heat Blast`
2. `Gauss Round`
3. `Heat Blast`
4. `Ricochet`
5. `Heat Blast`
6. `Gauss Round`
7. `Heat Blast`
8. `Ricochet`
9. `Heat Blast`
10. `Gauss Round`
11. `Heat Blast`
12. `Ricochet`
13. `Heat Blast`
14. `Gauss Round`
15. `Heat Blast`
16. `Ricochet`
17. etc.

Depending on your cooldown timers, you might use `Ricochet` as step 2 instead, and `Gauss Round` as step 4. Just check your cooldowns before activating `Hyperdrive`.

## Wildfire
`Wildfire` is an interesting ability. When you apply it to an enemy, it keeps track of everything you hit that enemy with while the debuff is active. It stores up 200 potency of attack every time you hit the enemy with an ability, then dumps all of that into a single explosive attack when the debuff timer runs out.

So, how does a Machinist squeeze as many hits as possible into a short time span? The answer is the `Hyperdrive` rotation described above.

The idea here is to use your basic combos to build your Heat Gauge up to 50 or higher, hit the enemy with `Wildfire`, activate `Hyperdrive`, and hit the enemy with as many `Heat Blast`, `Gauss Round`, and `Ricochet` attacks as you can. The `Wildfire` debuff should last long enough for your `Overheated` buff to run out, and leave enough time for one more normal attack, usually `Heated Split Shot`.

You won't always have `Wildfire` available when your Heat Gauge is at 50 or higher. You should still activate `Hyperdrive` at that point, since the `Heat Blast` rotation is still very damaging.

## Battery Gauge
The last hit of your basic combo, `Heated Clean Shot`, and `Air Anchor` will build your Battery Gauge. When the gauge reaches 50, the `Automaton Queen` ability becomes available. Because the `Automaton Queen`'s final hit, `Pile Bunker`, is more powerful depending on how much Battery Gauge is spent when summoning her, it is best to wait to use `Automaton Queen` until the gauge is at 100.

You don't have to control the `Automaton Queen` while she is active. She'll rocket over to whatever you're attacking using `Roller Dash`, she'll hit it repeatedly with `Arm Punch`, and when her timer runs out, she'll finish off with `Pile Bunker`. This basically makes her a colorful DoT.

If the enemy is about to run away, like most bosses in FFXIV like to do, you can manually use `Queen Overdrive` to force your queen to use `Pile Bunker` early. This will cause her timer to drop to 0 and she'll disappear immediately afterward, so use with caution.

## Other Skills

### Basic Rotation
When you have nothing else to do, your basic rotation is a good filler.
1. `Heated Split Shot`
2. `Heated Slug Shot`
3. `Heated Clean Shot`

### "Off Cooldown" Abilities
These aren't strictly "off global cooldown", as they still trigger the 2.5 second cooldown of the rest of your abilities, but they have their own recast timers.
1. `Air Anchor`
2. `Drill`

These should be use whenever they are off cooldown and you aren't Overheated. They're both 700 potency and cost nothing to use.

They are your strongest single-hit abilities, so you should only use `Reassemble` on them.

As mentioned before, `Air Anchor` also adds 20 to your Battery Gauge.

### Off Cooldown Attacks
I should spend some time pointing out some nuances with two other special abilities you have:
1. `Gauss Round`
2. `Ricochet`

These two can stack up to 3 uses each, giving you 6 off-cooldown abilities to weave in between your other attacks before you have to wait for them to refresh. Don't be shy about using these whenever they're available. Just make sure one of them either has one stock or less than half of it's cooldown remaining before activating `Hypercharge`.

`Ricochet` is also an AOE attack.

### AOE Abilities
Machinist doesn't have anything that complicated for an AOE Rotation, just a handful of skills with some interesting effects.

`Spread Shot` and `Ricochet` will be your most frequently available AOE abilities, which means they go at the bottom of your priority list when hitting multiple monsters. One very nice thing is that `Reassemble` affects **every** hit of the next `Spread Shot` you use, causing them all to crit.

`Bioblaster` is an AOE DoT attack that shares it's cooldown with `Drill`. When starting in on multiple monsters, use this first.

`Auto Crossbow` becomes available when Overheated, and deals damage to all monsters in a cone in front of you. Activate `Hypercharge` when facing multiple monsters and alternate between `Auto Crossbow`, `Gauss Round`, and `Ricochet` for some high damage. Unlike `Heat Blast`, `Auto Crossbow` doesn't reduce the cooldown timer on `Gauss Round` and `Ricochet`, so you'll run out of stocks for those before the Overheated timer runs out.

Lastly, there's `Flamethrower`. This is your hardest hitting AOE ability, but it has some drawbacks. When entering into your AOE rotation, you should start with `Bioblaster` to get the DoT running, position yourself properly, and use `Flamethrower.` After activating `Flamethrower`, you'll sweep your flamethrower back and forth, dealing constant damage to all enemies in a cone in front of you. You won't see the usual damage number on the screen like you're using a normal ability, but rest assured that you're dealing significant damage. If you move, the `Flamethrower` ability ends early, so don't do that unless you have to.

### Misc Abilities
`Peloton` is handy for the impatient party. It increases your walking speed, but can only be used when not in battle. Useful for those long walks between fights in dungeons.

`Tactician` reduces the entire party's damage taken by 10%. Useful for large raid-wide hits.

`Second Wind` is a decent self-heal.

`Head Graze` interrupts the enemy's attack (if it can be interrupted). It's not quite as handy as it used to be, but there are still a couple of fights where having this and using it at the right time can make things significantly easier.

## Priority List
You saw me mention a priority list earlier, here it is. Read down the list, and use the first available ability you come across.

### Single Target
1. `Reassemble` -> `Drill`
2. If Battery Gauge is 100, use `Automaton Queen`
3. If `Wildfire` is available and either the Heat Gauge is 50 or above or `Barrel Stabilizer` is available, use `Barrel Stabilizer`, use `Wildfire`, use `Hypercharge`, and start in on your `Heat Blast` rotation.
4. If the Heat Gauge is 50 or above or `Barrel Stabilizer` is available, start in on your `Heat Blast` rotation.
5. Use your basic rotation: `Heated Split Shot` -> `Heated Slug Shot` -> `Heated Clean Shot`, interspersed with `Gauss Round` and `Ricochet`

### Multiple Targets
1. `Bioblaster`
2. `Reassemble` -> `Spread Shot`
3. If Heat Gauge is 50 or above or `Barrel Stabilizer` is available, start in on your `Auto Crossbow` rotation
4. `Flamethrower`
5. `Spreadshot`, interspersed with `Gauss Round` and `Ricochet`

## Summary
Your goal as a Machinist is to build your Battery Gauge and Heat Gauge as quickly as possible in order to summon the `Automaton Queen` and use `Wildfire` in combination with your `Heat Blast`, `Guass Round`, and `Ricochet` rotation to deal maximum damage.
