Oh my god, I am so glad I'm in job isolated from sales people. There's just no way I could stomach spending any length of time with these people. Constantly interrupting your explanations with thoughts that just occurred to them. Overexplaining at times because their entire world revolves around them, then asking "Can I tell you why?" in the middle of their next explanation. I'm only on the outskirts and I already hate this person. At the core, she's just the first of our target audience we've had direct contact with. And all of them are going to expect us to come out with an application in 6 months that has all the features of the application that's been under development for 12 years. I'm also glad that I had actual work to do today to keep me busy.

This person also thinks that their workflow is the only one that matters. I spent 10 minutes explaining why we did things a certain way. I suppose I should be grateful that we're getting this taste in a small dose now. This is probably just a preview of what our real customer base looks like. They're all like this. They're all going to want the product to adhere to their specific workflow and anything else makes it unusable. As a guy who habitually conforms to the way an application wants me to do something, I just can't understand that. I suppose it's because I know what kind of work goes in to building an application like this and I'm hesitant to ask for changes unless I think they're REALLY useful because I hate when people do that to me.

I wonder how long this person has worked in this industry. They said that our company "isn't sure where to put them" which seems to indicate that she hasn't been around here very long, but that has no bearing on how long they've been a customer of ours.
