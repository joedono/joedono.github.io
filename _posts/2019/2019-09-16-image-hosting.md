Wow! I was pretty prolific this weekend. Added 5 new sketches since Friday. Most are still pokemon. I'm finding that their character designs are simple enough for me to do, but complicated enough that it takes me some time to do them. They're mostly done with really basic shapes. Although I still can't get head shapes quite right. I tried venturing out a little and drawing an actual human cartoon character. My kid used to love watching Hilda, mostly for the colors I think. I got everything basically right except for her head shape. It's too lumpy and not at all tight enough. At least the rest of the proportions are correct. I'll keep working on it!

I realized something disheartening when I went to admire my art page on my phone over the weekend. No one except me could see my art! I was using Google Photos to host the images. True to Google's file hosting of any kind, everything is only meant to be viewed or edited from inside the Google space. It's meant to be a more personal image sharing service, and not at all used for public image hosting. So I switched to Imgur. I'm not too happy with that, since I believe Imgur deletes photos that don't see any viewage after a while. Fortunately, even if that does happen, all my photos are at least archived somewhere. I'll keep the images up on Google Photos for now and transfer them onto my home computer when I remember to do that.

I don't know... Imgur just seems like such a trash heap. It seems to be trying to be a social meme platform, but I've never heard of someone doing a blog or making status posts on it. I'll use it for the image hosting, but I'm starting to feel dirty already.
