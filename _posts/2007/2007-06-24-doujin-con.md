Ok, this email is only going out to a select few of you...mostly because I don't really want to divulge where I went today to the rest of my friends. Today, I went to Tokyo Big Sight to my first convention while in Japan. The building itself was amazing. It looked like someone had built four pillars and four pyramids, then flipped the pyramids upside down and put them on the pillars. It was huge!

There was only one problem...it was a doujin convention. I was about as out of place as possible, looking at material that only had a few things I was interested in. The attendance cap was set at 8,000. I'm pretty sure we didn't make it that high. However, out of the 7,000 or so attendees, there were two foreigners (including me) and 10 guys (also including me). That figure should also give you some insight into the content of this particular doujin convention. Yup...it was 99.999999% yaoi. There was an entire section (about 20 booths) devoted to One Piece Sanji x Zoro comics, and another devoted to various Naruto yaoi. The weirdest ones I saw were Conan x Shinichi a la Dective Conan, various pairings of Ronin Warriors (my childhood!!), and something that had Dante...just Dante...on the cover. I bought one comic. It's from Haruhi Suzumiya and has the entire cast on the cover. Haruhi gets her hands on a yaoi comic and decides that Kyon and Koizumi should poze together for her. They never take any clothes off! (Thankfully).

The thing that I found the weirdest was that there was absolutely no Type-Moon at all! I think this was supposed to be strictly a yaoi convention or something. Oh well. There's supposed to be another 90 or so conventions within the next month (according to Evospace) so, hopefully I'll have a better time at those.
