It's that time again! Time to brainstorm a new D&D character.

My pirates campaign has had....less than stellar attendance, so our DM has taken the three of us that show up the most often and offered to start up a secondary campaign with new characters and running a module to cut down on the prep time he has to take. So, I requested that we run Dragon Heist, which I had started with another DM, but only got a couple session in before life got in our way and we stopped. I briefly considered resurrecting that character, a dwarvish Trickster Cleric named Yhorm Ironchest, but decided against it. I think it's time for me to dip back into being a meat shield this time around, since I've now played a monk, rogue, and wizard (for a bit).

So, I like to have variety in my character as far as battle options goes, but simple could be better. I'm looking to emulate some combination of Stiner from FFXI, Seigmeyer from Dark Souls, and Po from Kung Fu Panda. Basically, a fat beefy sort of a person with lofty goals of being awesome and a heavy case of "sempai noticed me" complex. I seem to gravitate towards that quite a lot.

So if I want to mix in spellcasting for variety, my choices are the Eldritch Knight or Battle Master paths for the Fighter, or being a Paladin. If I recall correctly, Dragon Heist is a level 1-5 module, so I shouldn't count on keeping this character into the higher levels. Eldritch Knight and Battle Master don't get their stuff until 3rd level, so if I want spellcasting early, it's Paladin.

I've never played a half-orc before. I've usually been human. So let's try that. I'm a half-orc paladin who's overweight and has dreams of being the dragon warrior. I could tend towards being fearful of beings I consider "more awesome" than myself or that I look up to, or I could tend towards being so eager to prove myself as awesome that I throw caution to the wind and rush into danger.

Alright, I'm a half-orc paladin from a small village where I ate too much and grew too big for the village to contain me, so they kicked my fat ass out into the world, which I was eager to get to anyway. I had heard great tales of adventure and dreamed of what it would be like to be those heroes, but never thought I could do it myself. The greatest heroes of orcs are all barbarians, but the greatest heroes of other races tend to be more noble. Knights and the like. So I switched to some sort of martial class with more structure. I probably discovered religion and started getting really into it, but in a goofy sort of way that made the other acolytes not take me seriously. Who would have thought that a fat half-orc could be a devoted servant to anything?

Now, what's my name? Unfortunately, the game I've been playing the most lately is Slime Rancher and....there are actually a handful of NPCs that I could pull from. Let's see...Thora, Viktor, Ogden, Mochi, and BOb. The main character is Beatrix. And that's it. I'd really like my character to have a really epic sounding full name that shortens to something silly. Like I'm called Marakadum, but my friends call me Mark. Bob is a good orc name, but how to extend it....Borbistramoon? Nah, I'm not liking this concept anymore. I think I hit it with Marakadum.

Alright, Marakadum (Mark) the half-orc paladin of adventure. Here I come!!
