title: Antidote to Negativity

I just happened on this motivational quote today that really struck a chord with me.

> The antidote to negativity is not positivity, it's Warmth.  
> Positivity tells a sad person that there's no reason to be sad  
> Warmth asks the sad person if they want to go get some ice cream.

I've been trying to put into words how I think people should treat me when I'm sad, upset, or otherwise having a problem. People who take the "misery loves company" approach and try to tell me about their experiences with the same issue actually make me angry. People who tell me that "it's no big deal" also make me angry. If I'm having a strong negative emotional reaction to something, the last thing I want is for someone to tell me something that makes me feel wrong or stupid for feeling that way. I don't want to be told that my problem is small or can be dealt with easily. I want to be able to feel like my strong emotional reaction is justified. If you tell me a problem is "no big deal," all I'm going to do is feel stupid for getting upset about it, which just makes me feel worse and doesn't actually solve my problem.

Instead, I wish people would take the distraction tactic. Let me vent, get my emotions out, and calm down. I'm perfectly capable of solving the majority of my own issues when I'm thinking with my brain and not with my emotions. Let me get things out, then engage me in something self-caring, like going to get ice cream and enjoy the day for an hour or so. Then, I can go back to the problem with a cool head and the solution will be almost immediately obvious to me **AND** I won't feel bad for being stupid enough to not see it before. Because the truth is, I'm not stupid. I'm actually pretty smart. But everyone is stupid when their emotions are running high. The rational part of the brain shuts down and people can't think straight.

So if I'm ever really upset about something, don't try to tell me that I shouldn't be upset or that I have nothing to be upset about. Accept that I'm feeling what I'm feeling and deal with that first, then deal with the source of the problem.
