Well, I have my computer running at nearly the capacity it was before. I only have three problems, only one of which I really have to solve. I have three applications that I can't re-install: NowPDF Writer (I don't think I'll be writing any pdfs for a while), Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (don't really need to make pictures), and Microsoft Office 2003 (yeah...that one's kinda important). I have the installation CD for MS Office, but I don't have the product key. Could you guys look around my room for the box or manual. I kinda remember it being in or on my desk or in the bookshelf behind my playstation. I can get by with WordPad for now, so no rush, although it would be kinda helpful.

Setting up my computer pretty much too up the bulk of my day today and yesterday. I did manage to find a really nice 300GB external hard drive for $150. What a deal! Anyway, please do your best looking for that key. Worst case scenario, I buy another copy somewhere here. It won't be that hard to find.
