I'm so excited that I can finally start talking about this. I've been working (hired?) by a start-up studio called ForgeMachine. We've been working on a classic style RPG that we're calling Thanataria: Rise of the Fallen. I'm extremely proud to say that we now have enough material to put the project up on Kickstarter.

The project is now live, and you can send us your support here:

Thanks so much!!!

Also, fun fact. This is my 100th post!
