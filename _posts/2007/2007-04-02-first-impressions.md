Well, this is it. It's 8:23pm on Monday April 2nd. I am sitting in my new dorm room suffering from extreme jet lag, mulling over the size and sheer lack of stuff in my new room. It's smaller than the one I had in Dolan, and I don't have nearly the same closet space. I can't even move my chair back 4 inches before I hit the bed, and I'm not allowed to move any furniture. Since it was a hour and a half train ride from the airport to here, I'm having my luggage shipped to me tomorrow. I have my laptop and backpack and all the luxuries they afford me. The bed comes with a mattress, a mattress mat, a cover for said mat, a linen sheet, a comforter, and a beanbag pillow.

Breakfast is served between 7:00 and 8:30 and no other time. Dinner is served between 6:00 and 10:00 (a little more lenient there). You get no choices on what you eat. They serve you enough for a full meal and you can choose not to take stuff.

The bathrooms have special slippers to wear inside that are all too small for my feet. There are two private shower stalls for the whole dorm (4 floors). There is one communal shower/bath that I'm probably never going to use. The clothes dryer doesn't work, so my laundry is dependent on the weather.

Jen and I got separated at the airport when our guides took us in different directions and I haven't been able to contact her since. My room is the first room in the dorm, which means that it's right next to the noisy lobby. And finally, just once more for good measure, I have no room in my room!

Ok, now that I have all that off my chest, time to move on to the upsides. Everyone that hasn't ignored me has been really nice to me. A lot of the people I talk to speak quite a bit of English (I need to get them to speak more Japanese). Those with whom I am able to exchange a few words with seem quite impressed with what little I know (either that, or they're smiling politely and making fun of me in
Japanese too fast for me to understand).

There are five other exchange students in the dorm in the same boat as me (the rest is, ironically, native students). There's even an exchange student who's already been here for half a year (he'll be our light in the tunnel). The supermarket and convenience stores are just a short walk down the street. The route to school is 45 minutes, but it's just one train. The yen that I brought over will be plenty unless I find a way to make my room bigger (seriously, I don't even know where I'm going to put my luggage bags, empty or not). But I have a working internet connection, which makes everything so much easier.

This is going to be one heck of a ride.

Whoofah! I'm pretty sure that's a complete list of the people who asked to be on my email list. If you got this email, know me, and aren't sure why you got it, it's because I assumed that you'd want to know about my adventures. If you got this email and don't know me, then please reply and tell me to remove you from this list. If you know anyone that's not on this list and you know they'd want to be, you can either forward the emails every time you get one, or tell me and I'll add them to my list.

On to the repeat of first impressions: I arrived yesterday at 3:30pm suffering from extreme jet lag. I lost Jen (my travel buddy) at the airport when our guides took us in separate directions. I spent an hour on a very nice train, then 15 minutes on a typical Japanese train during rush hour (absolutely no personal space). My guide pretty much quizzed my Japanese proficiency the whole way, along with pointing out things that I should remember the location of.

My room is tiny! It's probably 7'x12' and it's right next to the lobby. So I get all the noise of people coming and going. The upside is that I'll know whenever any of the other exchange students leave and I'll be able to run out after them. I have my laptop and backpack at the moment (It's 9:30 am here) and the rest of my luggage should arrive later tonight.

Dorm life is going to take some getting used to, even after 2 and a half years of college. The kitchen is open 7:00-8:30 for breakfast and 6:00-10:00 for dinner. They don't serve on Sundays, some Saturdays, or holidays and are apparently prone to taking random breaks. Fortunately, we have a vending machine right here in the dorm and there's a supermarket and a convenience store right down the street (I think). There is a communal TV, but it's in the dining room which is closed for most of the day (sorry Mattosai). There are a total of two private showers for four floors of residents (mostly native Japanese). There is also a communal bath and shower room which I'll probably never use. The clothes dryer doesn't work, so my laundry will depend on the weather.

I haven't taken many pictures yet as I am researching a free picture hosting site with no membership requirements (suggestions welcome).

It's about a 45 minute train ride from here to school, and it's a straight shot all the way. On the other hand, it seems that trains are known to switch sides from day to day, or even stop all together at a random station.

There are a few other exchange students here. Most are from America, but there are a few from Poland or Scotland. There's one that's already been here for half a year, so I'll be grilling him for info. After talking to them a bit, I realize that I'm a bit better prepared in terms of language than they are. Most of them took one semester their freshman year, a couple took it for one year, and there's only one who took it for three. So, I'm at the higher end of the scale this time.

I've only been here for 18 hours, and I'm already homesick. I have until 1:00 before me and the other exchange students leave and try to find our way to orientation. A few of us understand how to get train tickets, a few of us actually know where the station is, and a few of us know where we're going. A few of us even know how to get directions if we get lost. I know I'll be alright, but it's still overwhelming. I'll keep everyone posted. I'm probably going to be back here quite a bit.
