Added textures to the Plains area. I still have the issue of expressing to the player that they can go up to another screen. One of the rooms in Plains connects to the Clouds area. With the Forest area, the solution is easy: just use a tree. But Plains are harder unless I put in a mountain or something. Next up will be enemies and items in Plains.
