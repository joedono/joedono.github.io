title: Initial Design and Story

So the first game that I'll start blogging about is my current project. I started this project a little over a month ago. It's going to be a MetroidVania style 2D Platformer. The working title for now is "Unbalanced Equation". I'm developing this using C# and XNA 4.0.

The basic story is this: a madman has discovered a set of ancient ruins on an unexplored world. Within these ruins, he has found tools normally used to keep reality stable. Exposure to these tools, clearly not meant for humans, caused him to lose his mind and vow to unmake reality by unbalancing the equation the tools use to keep reality stable. You are a robot, part of a military force sent to stop this madman. As your fleet approaches the planet, the reality around the planet starts to break down. Your ship is the only one to make it through the turbulence. So it is up to you to make your way down to the innermost chamber of the ruins to stop this madman. Along the way, you will have to deal with the local flaura and fauna, as well as the effects of reality breaking down, in order to reach the madman and put a stop to him.
