So, this is me using Blogger. I'm JoeDono, a web developer. But that's not why we're here. I'm also an independent video game programmer. I've heard that a lot of developers keep a development diary. They do this for a few reasons:

* In case their game gets famous and other developers want to see how it's done.
* To keep track of their own progress so they can see how far they've come

So this is me starting my development diary. I chose Blogger mostly because it's Google. I already use a good number of their tools, and I trust that they're not evil.
