Can you believe it's almost August? That's practically the end of the year!

Anyway, I didn't end up competing in the Minimalistic Game Jam. Turns out going on vacation to a spot that has shoddy internet for the weekend was not conducive to working with a game engine you're not incredibly familiar with. I've only built the one project in Phaser, and it was dirt-simple compared to other stuff in my portfolio.

Using Tiled to make spline paths through the mansion proved to be a good plan. I do have to write out the paths manually. No copy-pasting and rotating here. I don't have the math for that. But it seems to work well enough with a quick conversion function written into the game. Next up will be actually spawning ninjas in the game and having them follow the paths with basic animation.
