title: "Darn It!!! Alright...new project!"

Since Unbalanced Equation has almost completely lost momentum, and I'm enjoying Python soooo much, here's the new project: The Great Ink-scape. (As in "The Great Escape" eh? eh?). I'm setting my sights a little lower for this one. One weapon, old-school level progression (Super Mario Bros. not Castlevania), 2D platforming, no exploration, one type of enemy (maybe two), and 5 levels (at most).

I'm almost pulling a Portal on this one. Let me explain. You may recall, back when Portal 1 was the talk of the decade, some smart Flash developer over at NewGrounds.com created <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404612">Portal: The Flash Version</a> for those of us who owned computers not powerful enough to run the actual Portal. It was a neat little game and successfully scratched many a Portal-itch. I'm going to be doing the same thing (creating a 2D version of a 3D game) except my 3D game, the source of my inspiration, hasn't been released yet. I'm speaking of <a href="http://giantsparrow.com/games/swan/">Unfinished Swan</a>. This incredibly unique first-person-adventure hooked my interest in 2006. I have been following their development ever since. But come on! When the most interesting thing you've done in the past year is a team-lunch at the Curry House, development must not be going too well.

So I say, Darn it!!! I'll do it myself.
