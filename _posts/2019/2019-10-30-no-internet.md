title: No Internet

We have no internet here today, and here I am blogging. Lol.

The irony is pretty funny, I gotta say. But that's what makes git really cool. I can still work on stuff like this, commit changes, and store up all my stuff for when the internet actually does come back. I can even start up this site and run it on a local server while I work on it. My own little pocket internet, provided I don't have to connect to anything external like a CDN or something, which I don't! ...except my art. I can't look at any of my art on this local site.

I would take this time to figure out what's wrong with the gems I use on this site, but without internet, I don't have any way to download packages in case I have to uninstall them. I installed Ruby on Rails a while ago, and something in it conflicts with the `jekyll-feed` plugin I use on this site. So whenever I build it locally, I have to disable that gem. I suppose I could just get rid of it entirely. It's not like anyone actually reads this thing, and it's even less likely that anyone who reads it actually pays attention to the feed. Eh, it's my blog and I'll do what I want!

DELETED!!

That is so much better. Now I can build and deploy without any changes to my local build. No more making tiny changes and reverting them. I suppose I could have configured a local dev version of this somehow, but it's my blog and I'll be lazy if I want to.

I'm rereading Dr Stone, making it one of a very short list of anime/manga series that I experience twice. I'm breezing through it just as fast as before, but I'm remembering a lot more this time. I'm back in the state I was in when I caught up with Attack on Titan, where I want to go look at the wiki or something to learn what the rest of the secrets to the world are, but they don't exist yet. I'm as up-to-date as I can possibly be. No one other than the author knows more about the series than I do. There are no other clues, no additional story, and no hidden nuggets of information. I have to wait....

I've finished up the last boss character sheet for my Weave playset. Now I can begin the editing process, assuming they don't go through and overhaul the rules again... If they do, I won't give up. The only thing that might make me give up is if they completely overhaul the rules **after** releasing the playset creator. If I have to re-import or do significant changes to my set through my phone, I'm out. If they release a desktop or web-based version, that'll be a much better story. What would also be nice is an "import" feature, but having worked in this field for a while, you usually end up generating your own UI for inputting data before you try to figure out some sort of standard file format to import. I still really like having my playset in markdown. I see other people using Google Docs and I just can't get behind it. It just seems like too much text to *not* have it all in, you know, text files. Plus, I can parse things out with my builders and generate characters automatically.

I'm really looking forward to NaNoWriMo this year. We're having a kick-off call in the Weave Discord this Friday, I suppose to figure out what everyone's goal is for the month and what they want to get out of the channel.
