title: Next Task Boss Battle!!

The next task on my list is to add a Boss Battle to the Cave area. Since the encounter is in a cave, it makes sense to have the boss be a Rock Monster. The monster's behavior is going to be pretty simple. It will leap off screen and try to land on the player. The force of it landing will cause rocks to fall from the ceiling, hurting the player. The tricky part of this will be getting the room layout to change after the monster's death so that the player can progress. I didn't code to have platforms that can switch on or off or moving platforms. Oh well, this is what I'm here to overcome.

Here's my first attempt at a rock monster. Pretty menacing, huh?
