I only had Japanese class this morning (boy, i really like my new schedule), but we have tests everyday for the rest of the week. I'm really glad I didn't sign up for intensive. They have at least two tests everyday, but they learn so much I'm jealous.

I had ballroom club tonight. I guess it was social night or something. They had decided that we knew enough stuff that they could just put on music and let us loose to practice what we wished. It was pretty fun, and I hope we do it more often.

I found out that tomorrow, the club will be going to the registration for the use of the rooms for the next month. From what I can tell, it's pretty much a battle between the clubs to get the rooms they want. I don't really see why they would want one room over another, unless there are more clubs than there are rooms (which is really hard to believe, considering how many clubs just go outside). So it's going to be a battle royale tomorrow afternoon. I have nothing to do besides Japanese in the morning and a bit of research later, so I might go check it out. I'll try hard not to get dragged into anything violent, but I doubt that'll happen.

On a much MUCH cooler note, Yuta emailed me. It wasn't out of the blue, I had actually emailed him through his website a couple days ago. I asked him when the next gathering would be and if there'd be fire. He said there's a BBQ party on the 26th. I haven't translated the rest, but I'm pretty sure it contains a rough location. The place is probably going to be someone's house, so it might be pretty hard to find. Hopefully, he'll include a map of some sort, but I'm not getting my hopes up, in case I don't find it. But, I'll try my hardest, and if I do find it, I gurantee plenty of pictures.
