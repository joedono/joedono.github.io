I must express apologies to my parents. I won't be on AIM tonight. It seems that fixing my computer has left some files unreadable, and AIM is one of them. In the meantime, I've backed up all my files on my new external hard drive (300GB for 150$, can you believe it!?) so I'm going to spend tonight reformatting my hard drive. It'll probably be a day or two before my 3-year-old OS disks catch up with all the updates, but if you don't get an email in the next couple of days, you are entitled to be a little concerned. If this takes longer than expected, then I will be checking my mail via the computers at school, so I'll still be in contact with you all.

In other news, I've finally learned that the ballroom club is actually supposed to be teaching us how to lead, but since we've been getting so many new beginners, they haven't had a chance to teach those of us who already "got it" how to improvise. I already know how, but they're teaching a different style with a more complicated basic step then what I learned in America. So the techniques are different, but they're finally starting to get interesting.

Well, I have homework to do.
