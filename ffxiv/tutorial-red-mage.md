# Class Tutorial - Red Mage

This guide was written for patch 6.3

Red Mage is a caster DPS class. This means a couple things:
1. You are ranged and usually stay away from enemies
2. You do the most damage when you don't have to move
3. You have to pay attention to your MP and manage it accordingly

For Role Actions:
1. Required - `Lucid Dreaming`
2. Highly Recommended - `Swiftcast`
3. Optional - `Surecast`, `Addle`
4. Why? - `Sleep`

Red Mage revolves around three concepts:
1. `Duelcast` and spell procs
2. Managing the White/Black Balance Gauge
3. Your melee combo and followups

## Duelcast
You get the `Duelcast` buff whenever you cast a spell with a cast time (which is all of them) and you don't already have the buff. When you have the buff, your next spell with a cast time has no cast time. This basically means that every other spell you cast has no cast time. This has a couple effects:
1. You are able to move around more than other caster DPS classes as you cast spells with the Duelcast buff
2. You are able to actually do your rotation, which includes spells with looooong cast times.

## Procs
This is where the bulk of your focus will be when playing Red Mage. Your rotation is full of random forks and divergences (which makes it difficult to express in text, but here we go). You have two kinds of spells: long cast and short cast. Your rotation will be
1. Cast a Short Cast Spell
2. Gain the `Duelcast` Buff
3. Cast a Long Cast Spell
4. Maybe get one of the `... Ready` buffs
5. Repeat

Which actual spells you cast will depend on your procs and where you are on the Balance Gauge.

### Short Cast Spells
1. `Jolt`/`Jolt II`
2. `Verthunder`
3. `Veraero`

### Long Cast Spells
1. `Verfire`
2. `Verstone`

You'll never want to cast `Verfire` or `Verstone` without having the `Duelcast` buff.

* If you have nothing, cast `Jolt`/`Jolt II` to get the `Duelcast`.
* If you have the `Verthunder Ready` buff, cast `Verthunder` to get the `Duelcast`.
* If you have the `Veraero Ready` buff, cast `Veraero` to get `Duelcast`.

Fortunately, the `Verthunder` and `Veraero` procs also light up the skill icons when you have their corresponding `... Ready` buffs, so you don't have to watch your buff bar.

Once you have `DuelCast`, cast `Verfire` or `Verstone`, depending on which side of your Balance Guage is lower.

## Balance Gauge
Along with the `Duelcast`, managing the balance gauge will be how you decide what spells to cast. Your goals are to keep the white and black energy gauges close together, and to get them both up to 50 (60 if you're doing an AOE rotation). If the gauges get too far apart, then the jewel at the top of the gauge will turn the color of the higher gauge, and it will be harder to raise the opposite gauge.

* `Jolt`/`Jolt II`, `Scorch`, `Resolution`, and `Scatter`/`Impact` raise both gauges a small amount
* `Veraero`, `Verstone`, and `Verholy` raise the White Mana gauge
* `Verthunder`, `Verfire`, and `Verflare` raise the Black Mana gauge

So, as said before, your rotation is full of "if"s. Here it is in full:
* If you don't have `Duelcast` or `... Ready` procs, cast `Jolt`/`Jolt II`.
* If you don't have `Duelcast` but you have `Verthunder Ready`, cast `Verthunder`
* If you don't have `Duelcast` but you have `Veraero Ready`, cast `Veraero`
* If you have `Duelcast` and your Black Gauge is lower, cast `Verfire` and hope that it gives you the `Verthunder Ready` buff
* If you have `Duelcast` and your White Gauge is lower, cast `Verstone` and hope that it gives you the `Veraero Ready` buff
* If both your Black and White Mana Gauges are higher than 50, do your Melee Combo and Followups

## Melee Combo
While you could technically go through your melee abilities whenever you like, the combo is only worth using when both your White and Black gauges are 50 or higher. As a ranged dps, it's understandable that you might have some trouble getting into melee range, so you have a gap closer ability and a jump back ability.

Your melee combo is:
1. `Enhanced Riposte`
2. `Enhanced Zwerchhau`
3. `Enhanced Redoublement`

### Melee Combo Followups
The above lessons will carry you through any content up to level 60. For levels 70+, you gain followups for your melee combos.

Each hit of your melee combo will grant you a stack of Red Mana, represented by red diamonds under your Balance Gauge. 3 Stacks will unlock your Melee Combo Followups, which you execute in the following order:
1. `Verflare`/`Verholy`
2. `Scorch`
3. `Resolution`

All of these have AOE properties, so they are also part of your AOE rotation. All of these also have no cast times.

`Verflare` and `Verholy` will automatically grant you the appropriate `... Ready` proc, provided you use them when the appropriate bar is lower than the other. For instance, if your White Mana bar is lower than your Black, executing `Verholy` will do damage, raise your White Mana bar, AND grant you `Verstone Ready`, but executing `Verflare` will only do damage and raise your Black Mana bar. The reverse is true if your Black Mana bar is lower.

`Scorch` and `Resolution` unlock at later levels and are simple high-damaging AOE spells with no special attributes.

## Other Skills
Everything above covers your main rotation. Of course, you have a handful of other skills that range in usefulness.

### Off-Cooldown Skills
`Corps-a-corps` is a low-damage ability that includes dashing to your target. This is useful both for dodging attacks and for closing the gap in preparation for your melee combo. It's free damage, so keep it on cooldown as much as you can.

`Displacement` is a low-damage ability that includes leaping away from your target. This is useful mostly for dodging attacks, but it can get you out of melee range after you're done with your combo. Be careful not to leap off of the arena!

`Engagement` is an off-cooldown melee attack with no special properties. It shares its cooldown timer and potency with `Displacement`. You can treat this as free damage and use it when using `Displacement` would send you to your death. Keep it or `Displacement` on cooldown as much as you can.

`Fleche` is your free, off-cooldown, single-target ranged attack. Use it whenever it's up for free damage between your other skills.

`Contre Sixte` is your free, off-cooldown, AOE ranged attack. Use it whenever it's up for free damage between your other skills.

### AOE Skills
Your AOE spells are
* `Verthunder II`
* `Veraero II`
* `Scatter`/`Impact`

`Verthunder II` and `Veraero II` are short cast skills that grant `Duelcast`, and `Scatter`/`Impact` is a long cast skill. So your rotation will be:
1. `Verthunder II` or `Veraero II`, depending on which side of the Balance gauge is lower
2. `Scatter`/`Impact`
3. Repeat

`Enhanced Moulinet` is your melee AOE ability. Similar to your melee combo, each usage of the `Enhanced Moulinet` will grant you a stack of Red Mana. 3 stacks will unlock your Followups. The difference is that `Enhanced Moulinet` costs 20 Black and White Mana. This means you'll want to build up 60 Black and White Mana via your AOE spells before getting close and using `Enhanced Moulinet` 3 times, then go through your usual Followups.

### Buffs
`Acceleration` is a really handy skill that guarantees that the next cast of `Verthunder` or `Veraero` will have no cast time and will give you the appropriate `... Ready` buff. Alternatively, it makes the next cast of `Scatter`/`Impact` have no cast time and a 50 potency increase in damage. So it's useful for both single-target and AOE situations. This ability is an excellent way to get yourself those `... Ready` buffs and should always be used on cooldown. This skill gets a second charge at level 88.

`Embolden` is a good damage-up buff. It increases your own magical damage and any nearby party members damage for a time. This means it doesn't affect your melee attacks, but it does affect your Melee Combo Followups. So use it when your gauges are low or when you've just finished your melee combo and are about to start using the followups.

`Manafication` is your best buff. It increases your Black and White Mana gauges by 50, and grants a buff that increases your damage dealt by 5% with enough stacks to take you through your melee combo and followups. Using this after executing a melee combo and followup to go straight into another melee combo is a good way to get both `... Ready` procs.

`Magick Barrier` is a basic defensive party-wide buff that reduces magic damage taken by the party by 10% and increases HP recovered by 5%.

### Misc Skills
These skills don't fit into any of the other categories and some have limited usefulness. Some are included for completeness, but others can save a raid.

`Verraise` is probably what the Red Mage is best known for. The advantage Red Mage has over Summoner and all the healing classes when it comes to raising dead party members is that `Verraise` can be affected by `Duelcast`. That means, as long as the Red Mage has a way to get the `Duelcast` buff (either through offensive spells or `Vercure`), `Verraise` can always be cast with no cast time. It's possible to raise an entire alliance with this ability. Hooray for perpetual Swiftcast!

`Vercure` has more limited usefulness. It's a short cast spell that both grants and is affected by `Duelcast`, which means you can cast it twice very quickly. Unfortunately, it takes two casting to equal the average healing amount put out by a White Mage's basic `Cure` spell. So, it's useful in a pinch, but your time is better spent doing damage.

`Enhanced Reprise` is like the Black Mage's `Scathe`. It's a ranged, weak attack with no cast timer. It costs 5 Black and White Mana to cast. Use it when you have to run and still want to keep up damage, but you're not sitting on a `Duelcast` proc or your melee combo followups.

## Summary
Your goal as a Red Mage for maximum damage is to use `Duelcast` and your proc abilities to raise your Black and White Balance Gauges to 50, then close the gap to your enemy and go through your melee combo and followups, and repeat.

To REALLY go for maximum damage, your goal is to get the `... Ready` procs as often as possible. You can do this with normal luck, `Acceleration`, and making sure to always go for your melee combo and followups when your Black and White Mana are not equal. If you can manage to get both `... Ready` procs going at once, you're amazing!
