title: "The Great Inkscape Version 0.0.0.2"
category: archive

New version is up on the Project Site. I've added a Projects widget (technically, it's a Links widget) to this blog (see right). Version 0.0.0.2 of The Great Inkscape is up on the projects page.

This version is much closer to the actual game than the previous version was. It now has enemies, checkpoints, and the first of many messages. I think I'm just going to have it be "Welcome to White World. Hope you enjoy your stay"

I don't have much left to do other than place messages in Levels 2-5. And then it's off to beta testing! I just have to find some beta-testers...
