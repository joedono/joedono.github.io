I've started going through a nice little tutorial on VueJS. I always got the impression that Vue was the runt of the big three JS frameworks, the others being Angular and React. I'm not sure how old it is or how much it's been developed against. I'm also not sure how many of the existing npm packages can be maneuvered around to the other places. Angular takes quite nicely to a really large number of other packages, but I'm not sure how rxjs, for instance, will play with VueJS. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's all the same. It all combines down into Javascript anyway at some point.

And one quick Google search later, I found how to import RxJS into VueJS. They've thought of everything!

I'm not sure I like how VueJS likes putting all of a component's code into one file. I never liked mixing HTML markup with too much scripting. It muddies the waters and makes managing really big applications really difficult. Angular's method of having separate html, ts, and css files seems much nicer by comparison. But then, if Vue is the runt of the litter, then it makes sense that it hasn't had to worry about supporting massive apps to the point that the community gets fed up with it and breaks from the pattern. I'm going to keep going with this and maybe make a small app to stick in my websites folder. Something that will consume an API and aggregate something again. Something stupid that's not actually useful at all. Just something nice.
