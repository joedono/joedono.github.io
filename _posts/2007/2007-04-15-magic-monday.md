Today's Sunday, and it looks like taking Sunday off from seeing incredible things is going to be a trend. I wasn't planning on doing anything today besides my laundry and homework, but I ended up exploring Kichijouji in the afternoon and wandering down BBQ alley in Shinjuku.

We found the alley shopping district in Kichijouji, where it looks just like a glorified alleyway, only with lots of shops. Too bad I forgot to take pictures for all of you. We found the local temple (I think, it might have been someone's house for all we know), and I took pictures of that.

After wandering around there for a while, we went to Shinjuku to see something I termed BBQ Alley. It's not actually called that. We were invited into a particular restaurant by a woman who spoke reasonably English. I listened to her talking to the other workers, and realized that she's Chinese. She led us up to the second floor (which was incredibly cramped) and gave us menus. The menu only had the daily special on it. We went to ask her some questions about the menu, and she assumed we were ordering. We were charged 7800yen (about $75) for four drinks and four tiny plates of meat. It was quite a ripoff.

We returned to Koganei and played at the arcade for a bit, and now here I am.

I just realized that while I've mentioned that I'm staying at a dorm in Koganei, I've yet to post any pictures of the place other than my room. I'll have to make a point of doing that in the next few days.
