I got feedback!!! And I'm going to start using images here!! And I've moved the posts related to this project to their own category so they'll be easier to find later!!

You guys seriously don't know how happy this makes me. Someone (2 people!) actually downloaded my game, played it, and liked it enough to give me feedback!! I tried making posts asking for feedback to Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, but I'm not that active on social media so I don't have much of a following at all. The posts have been up for a couple days and I got a couple likes and one response saying "I'll check it out," but no actual feedback. I also made a post on the LÃ–VE forums asking for feedback. And I got it too!! Not just any feedback, but feedback from an Inner Party Member. I don't fully know what that means, but I assume it's some combination of forum moderator, wiki contributor, and an actual developer who works on the engine. I'm so excited!!

They gave me some really good feedback too. I knew the sound effects for the footsteps was terrible and there are problems with the lights, environment, and ambiance. But they gave some pretty good suggestions for how to improve things. Smoothing the edges of the lights is a really good idea, and someone said varying the pitch of the footsteps sound effects would be a cheap way to make them less annoying while the player plays.

I've gotten quite a bit done since the last update. I've changed my plans and implemented a Panther scenario instead of a Bear scenario. I haven't playtested it very much, but just debugging it was very scary. I moved some of the pathfinding nodes so they're not snapped to the tile grid, which reduced the chance that monsters would get caught on corners in narrow hallways. I made the sight cones of the monsters rotate more gradually, which I should also apply to the player. And I added scenario progression. The game now has the ability to load with none of the scenarios unlocked and save when the player has completed a scenario. I just need to test this piece.

I've moved my timeline up by a month, now that I know how easy it's going to be to get the scenarios with physical monsters up and running. Pretty much every scenario except Ghost and Elder God are going to use a lot of the code I've already written for Wolf and Panther. And I want to get through implementing these scenarios as quickly as possible so I can start working on polish. One of the best compliments I got from this feedback was that the title screen and other non-game screens were going a long way towards making this project look more professional. I'm already researching video capture software so I can start putting devlogs in YouTube. Please look forward to it!!
