We've been watching an anime called Psycho-Pass lately. It's a really good show. It's a mix of Minority Report and White Collar. It's the same sort of society as Minority Report, only instead of using psychics and "infallible" prediction to determine who will become a criminal, Psycho-Pass uses complex personality analysis to determine who is capable of performing criminal acts. Citizens whose crime coeffecients rise too high are sent to therapy to try to bring it down. If it goes too high, the person is classified as a latent criminal and imprisoned or executed. Since catching criminals requires thinking like them, the police force employs certain latent criminals as Enforcers to help the normal police officers and detectives, who want to keep their coeffecients down, to catch them. Criminal tendencies are seen as a disease that spreads, is contagious, and increases in infection the closer one is to a worse criminal. Everything is monitored and processed by the all-powerful Sybil system, a complex network of computers responsible for maintaining a low stress level in the city.

I wanted to talk about an intellectual leap I made while watching this show and my thought process. This part will contain heavy spoilers for the series, so click the next section only if you don't care or have already seen the series.

    In the second half of the series, the question begins to arise "What is the Sybil System?" By this point, we've seen that the system isn't perfect. There are anamolies, people that can't be judged by the system and are essentially allowed to do whatever they please. So a couple of the characters (both villain and hero) locate and break into the heart of the Sybil System. I couple of episodes before, I tried predicting what the characters would find down there using the evidence I had been given and some principles of dramatic writing.

  <p>
    First, the series is set in a cyberpunk universe, so at least the characters would be expecting some sort of supercomputer. Second, a character established as an expert hacker determined that whatever is doing the processing must be completely housed in one location. No distributed network here. Third, this same character also determined that the amount of processing required to process character data of every citizen in the city would be far beyond what even the best computers known are capable of. Finally, there were still 6 or so episodes left *after* the characters make this discovery. Therefore, whatever the nature of the Sybil System, it must produce enough drama and intrigue to carry the story over the next 3 hours of storytelling, unless the writers phenominally goof up.

    With these in mind, what will fulfill what the characters know to be true, but subvert what they expect enough to produce enough intrigue to carry the series for another 3 hours?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, the characters know they will find a "processor far beyond anything we've ever seen, all housed within this one building." Since they live in a cyberpunk dystopia, hey are expecting a "cutting-edge electronic computer". The word "computer" is pretty nebulous, so we'll say they're expecting to find something "cutting-edge" and "electronic." To subvert their expectations, the writers will have to go against one or both of these concepts. Going against "cutting-edge" probably wouldn't produce that much drama. If the characters found an old Apple II computer, that would be the end of the interesting questions. The characters might be able to ask "Who put this here?", "Why is such an outdated piece of tech capable of running the Sybil System?". However, subverting the "electronic" would be far more interesting.

    So what sort of non-electonic processor would exist in a cyberpunk universe that has processing power far beyond our understanding? The answer was obvious: the human brain. I understood at that point that Psycho-Pass had pulled a Soylent Green on us. The Sybil System was people!! Or rather, the brain of at least one person, wired into circuitry and processing all the data coming in from the drones and cameras throughout the city. That would raise a great number of interesting questions. Whose brain is it? Are they there voluntarily or are they prinsoners? If the Sybil System isn't run by machines, then is it really so perfect as the citizens believe? Is it biased for or against certain people? With all the power that comes with having complete control over a city filled with sheep, is the brain behind the Sybil System completely corrupted by power? If the person within the brain has control, how much have they been influencing the characters we've been following?
  </p>
  <p>
    It turns out I was right on the money. The people that the existing Sybil System were unable to analyze have had their brains incorporated into this ever-evolving system (Matrix, anyone?) designed to watch over the city and its citizens like benevolent gods. Of course, now that our villain knows the truth, he's going to further subvert their expectations and refuse to be incorporated. Thus generating the maximum amount of drama and intrigue based on the story so far.

I'm pretty proud of my ability to read story-telling patterns to this degree and think the story through logically. I still can't manage actual mysteries or lateral thinking. I hate those sorts of puzzles. Like this one:
A hunter aimed his gun carefully and fired. Seconds later, he realized his mistake. Minutes later, he was dead.
Solution: It was winter. He fired the gun near a snowy cliff, which started an avalanche.

I mean, what the hell? How on earth is anyone supposed to figure that out? This one even has a bunch of alternative solutions right there on the site where I got it.
Solution #2: He shot an elephant with a low caliber rifle. Not powerful enough to kill it, the elephant became enraged and trampled him.

I suppose I've just been trying to solve these riddles wrong. The site I got these from says that you're supposed to solve them by having someone else read the answer before giving you the riddle. Then you ask them questions that they can only respond with "Yes", "No", or "Doesn't matter." That makes a lot more sense when I think if it that way.

I still don't like lateral thinking puzzles.
