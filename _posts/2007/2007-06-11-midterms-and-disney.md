So I finally got back one of my midterms. It was from history, and I got a 60...which somehow ends up being a C. This teacher has the most screwed up system of grading I've ever seen. He takes all the test results (which are in percentages), then divides them up so that there is a certain percentage in each letter. That way, at least 5% of the class is guaranteed to fail the test, no matter what they got. However, this also means that at least one person will be guaranteed a perfect score, no matter what they actually got. Oh well, I expected this to happen whether the teacher's style fit well with me or not. It is history, after all, my natural enemy. The fact that it's history of Japan helps a little, but not much.

I did my presentation on Western missions in China today, and I think I did pretty well despite not sticking to the topic completely. I was able to answer all the questions the class and the teacher threw at me. Now I don't have to worry anymore about this project until the end of the year. I can just let the rest of my group in on the research that I've done and they'll divide up the work as they wish. This is actually the way the teacher wanted us to do it. I'm not just doing it this way as an excuse to not do work. Heh.

Tomorrow, we're going to get tickets to Tokyo Disney. This'll be only my second time to a Disney theme park. I hope I haven't been too spoiled by the one in Florida. We'll be buying tickets for Thursday.
