I ended up taking the train all the way to Tokyo Station in the heart of Tokyo. Initially, I thought there wasn't much to see except huge corporate buildings, then I saw the word "Museum" on the side of one of them. It turned out to be the NTT Communications Museum. I walked over to the ticket stand and did a double take at the prices. Students got passes for less than 50cents!! Granted, I couldn't understand the bulk of the exhibits, but I could follow the timeline through the development of the telegraph, the rise of the postal system, and the invention of the television. By far the coolest thing in there was the stamp exhibit. Now I know next to nothing when it comes to stamps other than you need them to send things to people, but I was impressed by the sheer size of the collection. They were arranged in metal sheets on shelves that you could pull out to a certain point and swivel to see both sides. I counted 25 sheets per shelf, 96 shelves total, and an average of 70 stamps per side of a sheet. That totals something like 340,000 stamps! From all over the world! I really wish they would have let me take pictures. Oh well.

I spent the rest of the day wandering around Akihabara, and actually going in some of the stores this time. I never wish my PS2 played Japanese games more than I did today. I saw so many cool games, and it just killed me knowing that I couldn't play them (very few of them were PC games, which I could play). I'm definitely going to go back after I've rested for about a day.

I realize that a few of you have asked questions that I have yet neglected to answer. So here goes:

yes, that was a drum circle at the matsuri, but I missed my chance to talk with them and have no way of researching them right now.

yes, Sophia has a modern dance club. But it's not the one that looks like interpretive dance. It's actually hip-hop and the like.

no, AT is not something from star wars. The title of that picture was too long for photobucket. It's supposed to be ATM.

yes, I have emailed Sayaka but she hasn't gotten back to me yet.

yes, the bed is long enough for me, but the pillow is like a hard bean-bag. If formed right, though, it acts like one of those ergonomic pillows.

yes, I did receive all my old emails from home, and hopefully, those who've been out of the loop have too.

no, we haven't destroyed Tokyo Tower yet (despite the fact that I went to Tokyo).

no, that wasn't noodle soup that I took a picture of. It was okanomiyaki. They give you a whole bunch of ingredients and batter, then you mix them all into a pancake that you cook yourself.

Finally, yes, these emails will keep coming as long as this adventure is interesting enough to write about.
