I took a brief break from my other projects today to try out a proof-of-concept. I had an idea a while ago for a 2D platformer where you are equipped with a paint gun. You would have different types of paint that would affect enemies in different ways. Back when I had this idea, I wasn't experienced enough to think out how the code would work. It was too arbitrary and there was too much to think about for my skill level. This is really the first time I've done something like this without intending to make a full-fledged project out of it. It only took me a few hours to put together using Python and PyGame. I haven't decided on a project hosting service yet, so you'll have to make due with screenshots.
