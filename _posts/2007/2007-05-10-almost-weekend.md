Thank heaven! My weekend officially starts at 10:15 tomorrow morning, with the end of my first and only class.

Saturday is the Amity Club Asakusa tour. I'll be sure not to miss it this time around. Aside from that, not much else planned for the weekend. I'll probably work on my anthropology project on Otakus and what their rising industry has done for Japanese economy. It should be quite fun.

Tomorrow is also my last Japanese test for the week, we've had three so far. It's essentially a repeat of second year of Japanese back at Fairfield, but supplemented with real world practice everyday. That helps so much. I'm not to the point where I can watch the morning news (or game shows, as they usually are in the mornings) and understand them, but I hear that even native Japanese people have a hard time with them.

Asakusa is supposed to be famous for its shrines and stuff, so expect plenty of pictures. I'll try and remember to put myself in some of them.
