title: Level Design

Seeing as how the game is going to be in the MetroidVania style, there really aren't going to be "levels". Instead, there are going to be a series of areas that are blocked off by different types of barriers, each requiring a different item or ability in order to pass them. My initial design has 10 areas: Forest, Cave, Plains, Cavern, Clouds, Ruins, Water, Mountain, Volcano, and Lair. Total, there are going to be about 60 "rooms" or "screens" for the player to navigate, 6 upgrades/items for the player to collect, as well as numerous health upgrades.
