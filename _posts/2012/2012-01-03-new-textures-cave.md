Cave area now has preliminary textures. I plan on doing some heafty cleanup once the areas have been finalized. Adding decorations and flavor, cleaning up the tilesets themselves, etc. Next up is to include these textures in the Death Code of the Rock Monster so that the player can see the new platforms that appear when it is defeated.
