Another year, another Global Game Jam. Although this time, it's less of a thing to kick off an epic journey and more of a reminder that the previous year's journey is over and you should look forward to the next chapter. It's less of a prologue and more of an afterword.

Not that it will be any less amazing. It will probably be even more amazing now that I have a better idea what to expect., what to bring, and how to take care of myself. This year, I have the added burden of bringing along some of my coworkers. There is a good chance they'll look to me to take care of them during the weekend.

And this time, I'm bringing my own MtG deck.
