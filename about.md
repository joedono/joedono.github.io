## About Me
I'm JoeDono, founder of Little HIVE Studios

Little HIVE Studios was created in 2007, mostly just so I could put a decent splash screen on all my games that would tie them together a little bit.

### Game Development History
I made my very first game in 2003 in high school during a Visual Basic class. It was a slight step up from the typical text adventure games in that this had windows form controls. As far as first attempts go, it wasn't too bad. The code quality was terrible, as should be expected, but it was functional.

I started making "real" games in 2006 using GameMaker 7.0. I was already interested in computers and programming. What else is a young college kid going to do for private programming practice when he has lots of free time and not a whole lot of problems? After building a quick game or two, I realized that sticking with GameMaker would limit me to a hobbyist. The Computer Science major at my school used Java to teach the major aspects of programming, so I dug around and found [Killer Game Programming in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Killer-Game-Programming-Andrew-Davison/dp/0596007302), which got me started on actual game development.

In 2008, I started building games to put up on my personal website. This was back when the Java Applet was still a viable paradigm for small web applications. Flash hadn't yet completely taken over and fewer people were aware of the security risks of applets. I had a pretty good thing going. I cloned a ton of games from my childhood of varying complexity: Pong, Breakout, Tetris, Haunted Mansion, Pac-Man, Othello, and even a programming game-within-a-game from The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain. I created enough that I had my own little library of classes that could almost be a project template for my work. Eventually, I got bored with Java and starting looking around for "real" game development tools.

I tried Python first, and after a couple of false starts, I completed The Great Inkscape in 2012. I considered this my first "real" game. The first one I thought was good enough to put on someone else's website. It might still be available on [Pygame.org](http://www.pygame.org/project-The+Great+Inkscape-2184-.html) but it's definitely up on my [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/joedono/The-Great-Inkscape/releases). I had a couple of other failed ideas and hit a massive roadblock when I tried to package my game for distribution. PyGame is not easily packaged into executables...

So I started hunting for other tools. Of course, I found a ton: GameMaker, LÖVE, ZGameEditor, Sphere2D, Flixel, Haaf's Game Engine, SDL, Unity, Source, Unreal, LimeJS, XNA, RPGMaker, Stencyl, and many others. It got to the point where I was spending more time collecting game-making tools than actually making games. This was also around the time that I changed jobs, so my personal game development stalled for a bit while I got used to a new job with new tools to learn.

In 2013, I decided to change all that and actually try making my own projects again. As luck would have it, 2013 was the first year of the [OneGameAMonth](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) challenge. I signed up immediately and set the additional goal of using a different game development tool for each project. I didn't end up completing that goal, but I got close. I grew so much as a developer during this year. I attended my first real game jam in the form of Global Game Jam 2013, I worked with a remote artist for the first time, and I "completed" more projects than I ever had before. At least "completed" them enough to put them up for the world to see on a website that actually got traffic. By now, there are over 10,000 games available on the 1GAM website made by around 16,000 people. But my name is still there on the Highscores list.

After that, I stalled out for a little while again. I picked up a position as a volunteer webmaster for a convention I frequently attended, and my job was giving me more responsibilities. I was invited to work on a team with some friends on their dream project. They wanted to make a classic RPG with a grand story. I could tell right away that we had a very slim chance of succeeding. The team all had very different expectations of what would be required of them. The project fell apart and I went back to being a stalled hobbyist developer.

But all was not lost. My game development was once again jumpstarted by the Global Game Jam in 2016. I arrived late, so I ended up working alone. That gave me a good opportunity to limit my own scope and spend the rest of the time observing other teams. I wrote a full blog post about this, but the short version is that I was really able to see how far I had come.

I'd settled on building small-ish games using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework, mostly for the ease of distribution, portability, documentation, and the overall "cuteness" of it. It's probably still my engine of choice.

Then, in 2019, I decided to take another plunge and start leveling up my art skills. I dug out a sketch pad I had owned since middle school and started sketching from reference. It was just direct-copying, nothing too fancy, but it helped build muscle memory in my hand and get me comfortable with drawing. I filled up the sketch pad during Inktober of 2019. I cheated and used pencil, but it was still a good motivator. My original goal was to level up my art enough so that I could do my own art for my own games, but I just couldn't seem to stop sketching! I started taking steps to switch to digital art, but I have a long way to go. If I ever do get my art up to snuff, then the only things that will be left are the sound effects (BFXR) and the music (all over the internet) and then I'll be a full-stack game developer.

### Behind the Name: Little HIVE Studios
When I was a freshman in college, there was a group of older students I hung out with. They called themselves "The Hive" and were a group of the most interesting people on campus (at least, I thought so). I had a group of friends who were closer to my age that kind of broke off from the original HIVE. When it came time to come up with a studio name, I choose "Little HIVE" as an homage to the group that made me a more interesting person.

### Behind the Name: JoeDono
Again, when I was a freshman in college, I joined the school's Anime Club. One week, we started watching the first season of Shaman King. In this series, the main character is a shaman named Yoh who summons a samurai from ancient legend to be his guardian spirit. As most actual samurais did, this one called his master by the honorific "-dono," which basically means "Lord." My actual name is Joe, so applying the main character's moniker of "Yoh-Dono" to me wasn't that big of a stretch. The name stuck. It actually got to the point where people thought that "Dono" was actually my real last name. Fortunately, my real last name is a lot cooler.
