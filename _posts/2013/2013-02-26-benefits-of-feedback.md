title: "Benefits of Feedback"

It seems silly now. Really, I can't believe I didn't take advantage of this sooner. The Internet is an amazing device. It's ability to deliver instant feedback from anywhere in the world is unparalleled. One just has to get over the fear that the feedback may be terrible. There may be people out there who hate what you've created. Worse, there may be people who don't have any strong feelings about what you've created, but say terrible things just to be trolls.

The reason I'm talking about this is that it's something I just recently discovered the benefit of myself. Soon after finishing up my 1GAM entry for February, Smoke Rush, I posted a link to the project page to every social network I'm a member of. Overnight, I got good feedback, including some ideas for new features I hadn't thought of. Things like having the canisters you pick up drain over time, having the number of points you get depend on how full the canister is when you pick it up, having more than one canister on the screen at a time, and powerups. I immediately saw the benefits to all of these. They all increased player engagement. I just HAD to implement them asap.

The first 3 were easy enough to sketch out in my head and I was able to implement them pretty well within a half hour. The powerups were another story. They would take more time than I had left to work on this project. I had already decided to take this week and learn Lua/Love2D for use in next month's project. Between that and a full-time job...I wish I had more time to spend on this one.

The lesson here is: get feedback. Get it often and get it early. Get it as soon as you have something that can be considered a game. Get it from everywhere.
