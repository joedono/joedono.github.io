This weekend was a fun one. I went to the Tokyo Toy Show at Big Sight on Saturday. It was quite the experience. They had all kinds of toys on display that would be available within the next month. I'll have to let the pictures do most of the talking, but suffice it to say, it was a fun time. They had a Rubik's Sphere (that I couldn't buy), an Air Guitar machine (also couldn't buy), loads of Transformers and Star Wars figures (same), a really cool display for the new Gundam series that's coming out soon, waaaaaaay too many puzzles (a lot were for sale, I bought one of those 3D plastic puzzles), and a lot of other really cool gadgets. I even got to become a Transformer for a little while.

I went again on Sunday with Jen. She didn't get to come on Saturday, and she didn't want to go by herself. So I gave her a tour of the place.
