title: Life Goals

I've had a handful of conversations over the past couple years where some variation of "What are your long term plans?" gets asked. What do I want for my career? What are my life goals?

I've never had positive answers for this. I'm pretty satisfied with my life right now. I'm working in the field I wanted to be. Or rather, I've given up on working where I wanted to be because I realized that being a video game developer was a thankless job with very high rate of failure. The industry churns through developers and doesn't believe in burnout. Definitely not what I wanted to do as a career. I wanted to be a dad, and now I am. I wanted to visit Japan, and I did. And that's....about it. I was making strides last year to be comfortable wanting things. I don't know why I am this way. I'm not selfish. I'm very uncomfortable wanting things for myself.

I think it's time for a change. I want some form of direction in my life. To work towards something, no matter how mundane it is. I have plenty of hobbies I enjoy for the fun of it, but I feel like I'm just killing time until I retire or something. I suppose there's almost nothing wrong with being content with where you are in life, but I can't help but wonder if I could be happier. Maybe I just start with a little thing. Anyway, I'm here to jot down some thoughts for things I want to change in my life, no matter how vague.

So what do I want to change about my life. What do I want to do?
1. Become a better singer
2. Publish a video game I'm proud of
3. Become more social and extroverted and have more friends
4. Build a website that generates passive income
5. Be a good father and husband
6. Get a Master's degree
7. Learn the piano again
8. Learn woodworking
9. Figure out what to do with my savings
10. Get down to 230lb or lower (get a six-pack)

It's amazing how many of those are just "learn X new skill." That's not really what I wanted out of this. The problem is, I don't know what I want. I'm constantly thinking about a quote from Haikyuu that really stuck with me: "You don't have to be super passionate about something to start doing it." I'm interpreting that as, I don't have to want something so bad that I can't sleep before I start doing it. That's at war with a speech I listened to about success: "When you want something as badly as you want to breathe, that's success." I don't really want anything that badly, badly enough to sacrifice anything. Everything I've done so far has required me to sacrifice very little, just time.

I want to start a small "accountability" notebook. Something that I write in either every night or every morning. I write down "Today/Tomorrow, I will XXXX" and that XXXX has to be something that moves my life towards one of those goals.

I suppose my biggest things up there are:
1. Become more social and extroverted and have more friends
2. Figure out what to do with my savings
3. Get down to 230lb or lower (get a six-pack)

And for 1, I don't even really know how to start at this stage in my life. I have extremely limited time to spend on things outside my family. But I suppose I'm getting better about that, just through the online interactions. I'm making some friends on Twitch, I'm becoming more active on Facebook, and I'm having the occasional text conversations with people. For 2, I feel like I have to go to H&R Block or something to figure that out. My biggest problem there is that my savings is just sitting there. I want to do something with it that might multiply it, but also leaves open the ability for me to quickly withdraw from it in emergencies. I just don't know who to ask and how much that will cost me. 3 is supposedly easy to outline, just hard to enact. I had a hard enough time keeping up with Keto, and only lost 20lb. Getting down to having a six-pack is a full-time commitment that I just can't afford. Either in time or in money.

Of course, all of this would be within easy reach if I just gave up video games. I'm starting to encounter many more people who just never developed that hobby, and I'm amazed at how boring their lives must be. Then I look at my own life, and realize that I'm not much better. Maybe this is all just my life as a father catching up with me. I'm constantly aware of how much time I have to spend at home with my wife and kid, and how much I dread eating into that time to spend it on myself. But you know, most of those goals really are things I can do at home with just the two hours I get in the morning. I don't even really have to give up all of my gaming, especially now, when we're between content patches.
