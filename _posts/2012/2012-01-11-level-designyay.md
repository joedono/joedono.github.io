title: "Level design...YAY!"

I got to the point where I just said "Screw it" and hacked out about 10 levels today for Wizard Plumber. I realized something I probably should have realized a long time ago. Your levels are going to suck the first time around. You can save yourself a lot of headache if you just accept this fact. Just put something into the game, play it, THEN worry about balance, increasing difficulty, and so forth. It's amazing what you will come up with once you have something on the screen that you can play around with. In the end, that's what level design should be. Smacking a design together with a little thought put in to things like "Is this solvable?", putting it into the game, and THEN tweaking it, redesigning it, and trying again.

Too often in the past, I would get bogged down worrying about difficulty, balance, and player interest in the initial phases of level design. And that would stop me from getting anything done. Not anymore! Tomorrow, I give my first 10 levels a dry run, then I build the next 10.
