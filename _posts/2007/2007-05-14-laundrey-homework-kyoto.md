I finally finished most all the reading that was supposed to be due this week. Now all I have left is to write a 3-page paper comparing two autobiographies about two men living in the Samurai era. I'll do that tomorrow afternoon.

Tomorrow night...WE LEAVE FOR KYOTO!!!! There are four of us going and we'll be staying at the Orange Inn until Thursday night. We'll take the overnight bus there, which is a 7 hour trip from 11 at night until 6 in the morning or so. So we'll be sleeping for most of it. Then we'll get back early Saturday morning. I've already done my laundry, so I'll have plenty of clean clothes for the week. I'll of course take my camera with plenty of extra batteries.

Don't know exactly what we're going to see yet. I'll be taking my guide book, but David says he has a plan so that we'll get the most out of this trip. Apparently there's one street in particular where all the street performers and vendors gather, so we'll get most of the culture we're there for in one go. This'll probably be the only chance we have to spend any length of time outside of Tokyo, so we're going to squeeze in as much as possible. This is going to be interesting.
