Not much to report today. Classes start tomorrow, so I figured that I should take a break and not to anything today.

I did do some research on the poi community here. They are apparently a lot more organized than we are, as they have an official website with organized events and stuff. The next one is on May 5th, and, upon showing some of the foreign students here videos of firespinning, they are begging me to take them. It was quite amusing. I'm going to head down to Yoyogi park this weekend to see if they've started gathering yet. They supposedly only gather in summer, but I don't know how warm they consider summer to be. I'm really excited.

I'm also excited that school is about to start. That means that all our social lives will explode. It also means homework, but it's totally worth it. Class starts at 9:15 tom morning, which means I leave at 8:15, which means I have to wake up at 7:45 at the latest. That's not so bad. Wish me luck!
