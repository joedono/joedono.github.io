Man, I wish that Blogspot had a Recycle Bin.

Anyway, I was brushing my teeth the other day when I saw the scented candle that we keep on our sink. It reminded me of the power outage we had a few weeks ago. I remembered trying to brush my teeth by candlelight. Then it hit me: we should get some more flashlights.

Then it hit me again: I bet I could make a game around this. After all, the developers of Angry Birds started with nothing more than a picture of what eventually became the bird mascot of the game. So I decided to take the concept of "candles" and see if I could design a game around it.

The result is Candlehead. A(nother) 2D platformer based around the idea of hiding things from the player.

<b>Character</b>
You will play a living candle. You can walk, jump, and make your flame burn brighter or dimmer. Your body will be made of wax. The flame will steadily drain your wax until you run out, at which point the flame will go out and you will have to navigate in darkness. Making your flame burn brighter will illuminate more of your environment, but it will also make your wax drain faster. This could be a good thing too, as your size is dependent on how much wax you have. If you have too much wax, you will not be able to fit through some of the passageways.

<b>Enemies</b>
* Timid Monstrosities - creatures that can see and be seen in the dark via their glowing eyes. They are afraid of light and will run away from you if your light is burning brightly. If your light dims or goes out, then they will eat the wax that makes up your body and kill you. There will be a walking type and a flying type.
* Roaming Monstrosities - creatures that cannot see or be seen in the dark. They can be heard, however. They are harmless if they can't see you, but will attack you if your flame is burning brightly.

<b>Items and Interactables</b>
You can pick up bits of wax to refill your supply a little. There will be other flame sources that you can use to relight your flame. There will be wax stations that you can use to refill your wax to full.

<b>Premise</b>
You have displeases your wizard master by attempting to woo a girl with one of his magic adjustable-brightness candles. These candles are very hard to make, that was your master's last one. In his displeasure, he decides to teach you a lesson and turns you into an adjustable-brightness candle. He does this as you are running out the door into a storm. The rain carries you away and down a storm drain. You have to get through the sewer and back to your master's workshop so he can turn you back.

I am drawing a little inspiration from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airball_%28video_game%29">Airball</a>. Airball is an old DOS game that I used to have. You are a rubber ball of air with a slow leak. An evil wizard has trapped you in his massive mansion and you have to escape without deflating or popping. Littered through the mansion are refilling stations that will refill you with air, but staying on one for too long will cause you to pop. It had decent graphics but terrible controls.

I haven't made a game yet where lighting mattered. So that will be something new. I also wanted this one to look better than The Great Inkscape. I don't have the luxury of everything having to be only two colors. I debated using this project as motivation to learn Lua and Love2D, but I think I'm going to stick to Python and Pygame for now.
