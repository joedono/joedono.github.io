title: Curses Mood

I'm here to brainstorm the "mood" of Sia Malak. I've finished filling in all the player facing qualities, the locations, and some of the themes. I'm at the point where I need to fill in the rest of the....world: the NPCs, the Enemies, and the Bosses. Oh, and Plot Twists. So, basically everything the players have to interact with.

So do I make set goofy? No, absolutely not. This is meant to be a sequel to Iron & Salt, which is....supposed to be a serious set. Which of course means that my players will eventually do something stupid and get into humorous situations all the time. So do I do a serious set? Probably mostly. I'll probably put in one or two "joke" themes.

My biggest obstacle is coming up with non-player characters. I need to come up with.....66 of them. No, that's not right. 22 Cards, 2 NPCs, 2 Enemies, 1 Boss = 5 per card. 110 non-player characters...joy. Probably my biggest issue will be what percentage to make pure bred monsters and how to come up with the hybrids. I suppose one way would be to generate new characters using the talents and backstories I already wrote. It'll probably be a good idea to generate things based on the distribution of the locations. That'll give me a reasonably even spread of stuff.

Actually, maybe I should come up with the themes first. I don't actually know how many of those will be crisises that will involve fighting or what will be social struggles. I have a couple involving uprisings and human discovery, but I should fill in the rest. That will probably inform what kind of bosses and enemies that can menace the players.

Alright, let's get to work.
