I'm attempting a couple of new things nowadays. I'm working on my visual design skills.

I downloaded a simple memopad/drawing app for my phone and ordered a couple travel styluses. My goal was to try and draw something almost every day. Unfortunately, I drew a crappy turtle and then kept leaving my stylus in my office and never taking it with me. I thought I'd have a ton more time that I'd have to fill with whatever I had in my pockets, but I keep finding a way to put my son next to me on the couch or in the comfy chair in my office so I can use both hands to play games or something. I really want to try and get this going. My artistic ability has always frustrated me, and I keep thinking I suck, even though that should be obvious and I should just work through it.

The other thing I'm doing is trying to design a website for a fake customer. I heard that's a good way to build design skills without the normal opportunities. So I came up with Pork Bowl Con, a nerdy convention with a hearty attitude. I've even come up with a logo for it. So far, it's going ok. I'm torn between trying to make the design what I want it to be and just getting the content up with the default bootstrap stylings. I'm thinking that just getting it up would be the better option. The trouble is, I think I'm starting to run into a wall as far as coming up with the content. I guess that's what I should think of as the good part of this. The content can be absolute shit for now. I just hae to get something there.
