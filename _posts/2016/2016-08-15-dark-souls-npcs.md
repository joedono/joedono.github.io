All I want to do is go home and play Dark Souls III. I'm making my way through my second playthrough, and I'm having a much easier time doing things, partially because I picked the Fire Gem as my starting gift and mostly because I'm using a guide this time. I just beat the Crystal Sage and I'm pretty sure all I've missed are minor item drops. But I'm super paranoid that I'll do something that will close off one of the NPC questlines.

I have Grierat sitting in Firelink after his first outing. There's a chance he might die on his second outing unless I go through Patches or Siegward's questlines far enough that they can save him. I'm not at all sure where I stand with Sirris. I'm tracking Siegward's questline, but the next part is finding him down the well and I want to make sure I don't end that part if his questline prematurely and have Grierat die. I have Irina sitting around waiting for more tomes. I apparently have to farm up enough souls to buy all her light miracle. I'm trying to make this my "good" playthough. Everyone lives all the way to the ends of their questlines and has a good time accomplishing their goals. I'll probably try one more playthrough after this one to get the "evil" endings. Which is good, because I have two more endings to get through, and one of them doesn't seem to require very much.

That's that then. I'll see if I can get through everyone's questline this time around, then I'll go through the wedding and the Lord of Hollows ending.

The worst part about all this is the heat from the weather is causing my computer to have trouble staying cool. That means I'm stuck playing for a half hour each morning and an hour or so at night. That's giving the game a really choppy feel, especially since I'm going through and trying to get everything. I'm using a really simple Blood and Fire build, although I forgot to bump my Luck up. I'm not really planning on keeping this build all the way to the end. I'm going to infuse the sword with something else later to get good scaling back. It's been really good to me in the early game (plus I've gotten pretty good).

Now I just want to go home and play.
