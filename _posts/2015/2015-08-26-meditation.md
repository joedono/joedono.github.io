I finally did it last night! I got a full night's sleep after my injury. It didn't wake me up. Now, that might have had something to do with the fact that I was up at 4am yesterday morning and was just generally sleep-deprived. But it still felt incredible. I feel so much better today.

Another possible reason for that is that I'm going to try and take up meditation in the morning. Nothing huge. I only meditated for about 5 minutes this morning. But I already feel more alert and calmer than I normally do at this time of day. I've known for a while now that my days have been far too full of random, useless information. I spend a lot of time on Reddit and YouTube consuming random media. Some of it is more useful, like when I discovered this blogging software and GitHub Pages. But it's mostly drivel that I forget about almost as soon as I read it. It's pretty ironic though. As I write this, I'm listening to a podcast on YouTube.

The question now is what to meditate on. I've done guided meditation before and meditated when I had an objective in mind. But I've never just meditated before. This morning I meditated on what I want to change about myself. I want to be more fit and more confident. I want to improve my motivation to diet and exercise. I've been able to use "being hurt" as a good excuse for a while, but I think that's about to run out. I brought my jogging shorts to work today. I'm heading out on the trail when I'm done for the day.
