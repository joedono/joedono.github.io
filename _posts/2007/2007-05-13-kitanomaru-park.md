So, I didn't really do much of anything yesterday, but I didn't get a whole lot of sleep for some reason. So I woke up today around 1:30pm.

I went to Kitanomaru Park (still not sure if the spelling is right) to see the Budokan and the Imperial Palace. Well...I got to see the outside of one and the front gate of the other. There was a concert at the Budokan (apparently it's used for more than just judo) and the Imperial Palace was completely closed. I know that most of the Imperial Palace is closed to the public all the time (except the Emperor's birthday, which is sometime in December) but I thought I could get into the East Garden, which was supposed to be open to the public all the time, except holidays, mondays, fridays, and any other day that the Emperor needs to deal with political things. So it was closed today.

The concert at the Bodukan had something to do with an anime called Sakura Wars.

There were a lot of cosplayers walking around, but I had only heard of Sakura Wars, and never seen any of the characters, so I didn't know what was going on at first. I contemplated staying and trying to get a ticket, but I was invited out for nomihodai (drinking party) to celebrate measles week and didn't want to tire myself too quickly.

After walking in the park for a little more, I finally found the entrance to the Imperial Palace with a big sign saying "Keep Out" in five languages in front. However, I think I might have found the site that Mattosai was talking about, where you walked through a gate and into an area with high ledges on two sides and you pictured archers aiming at you like you were an intruder. I got a similar feeling (of course there were no archers) and took a picture of the site. Forgive the skewing in the Photoshopping of the picture. I wanted to get a bit of the entranceway in it.

The nomiihodai was fun. They also had karaoke (I'm liking karaoke more and more) and I sang "Don't Say a Word" by Sonata Arctica. I was so surprised they had it. Those of you who should be happily surprised (or freaking out) because you know what I'm talking about, feel free to do so. The rest of you, know that Sonata Arctica is a power metal band that I really like.

It's official, we're going to Kyoto. One of the guys here bought us overnight bus tickets for Tuesday night and we're going to come back Friday night. That gives us all of Wednesday, Thursday, and most of Friday to explore the city. I'm probably not going to have enough time to visit the friend I made at Fairfield who lives in Kyoto because she's actually entertaining two other American guests (who I don't know) and won't be around until Saturday. We'll be staying at a cheap hotel while we're there, and there's at least three other people I know that are going. I'll have to take plenty of extra batteries (and money) but it'll be another adventure.
