Hello everyone, sorry for the late report. What a day today was. I spent the first half of it attending my district's Sakura Matsuri (cherry blossom festival) in the park and the rest out at Karaoke with Jen and a couple of her friends.

The matsuri was amazing, but only some of you will truly appreciate everything I saw. We got there just as it was starting, so there wasn't much to see except the governor's house and various other architectural pieces with some history that had been moved here to Koganei. I went with two other foreign students, David and Marvin.

As you can see, there were several amazing things that we saw. I also took a set of pictures that I hope to photoshop into a 360 degree picture of the center of the park. I saw a Japanese Drum Circle! I was so excited about finding that. I saw a person training others in the art of the short sword. I saw a judo demonstration! I almost tried to join in, but I thought it might be a little rude. I saw a taiko drum show, with costumed actors and everything. And I saw a fan dancing class (but I didn't get a picture of it).

We decided to take a tour of the governor's house and whatever was behind it, which is where all those pictures without people came from. Those were seriously amazing. That weird looking set of wooden planks is actually a bridge. The belief behind it is that evil spirits can only travel in straight lines. So if you cross the bridge, they won't be able to follow you. They had designed the area behind the governor's house like it was Edo (ancient) Japan. I felt like I should seen Kenshin walking past me or something.

Later today, I met Jen in Akihabara (anime paradise) and we explored a bit. We found plenty of things that'll make certain people cry (you know who you are) and we took many pictures (yes, that is vol 1 of Fate/Zero, and it's sitting on my desk).

Me and the other two guys that went to the Sakura Matsuri are going to try and convince the other foreign students to come with us to the festival tomorrow (it's three days long and today was the second day). I wonder if it'll have the same amount of fun.
