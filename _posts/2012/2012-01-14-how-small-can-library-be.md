title: "How small can your tools get?"

I've been going through a period of obsession with Portable Software. That is, software that you can run off a USB key and not have to rely on a PC having anything special installed. This is a bit of a waste to me now, since I do all my computer work on one of 2 computers and I have (almost) complete control over what goes on both of them. It would have been much more useful back when I was in college and spent a good deal of time working on the library computers.

Nevertheless, I have amassed a pretty good sized collection of portable software. My latest addition is Love2D. At just 3.8 MB, it is the smallest game programming library that boasts everything necessary to build and run any 2D game while still being relatively easy to use that I have ever encountered. It will definitely be the next thing that I start learning once Wizard Plumber is finished.
