title: "Different Order"
category: archive

I'm changing the order that I usually do things around. Usually, I focus on the gameplay and level design first before I tack on a title screen and options and a full game cycle and...

So, this time, I'm trying it in a different order. I have a prototype already of how I think the gameplay is going to work. At the very least, it proves that I can adequately render a light source in 2D (go me!). So, I went ahead and got started on the...framing device of the game, shall we say. I've got a rudimentary title screen and a controls/options screen that is fully functional. Now that that's out of the way, I can start working on the gameplay and it will look more like a full game right from the start.

Oh, and did I mention that I might be commissioning some work from an ACTUAL ARTIST. This game might actually start to look good eventually (gasp!).
