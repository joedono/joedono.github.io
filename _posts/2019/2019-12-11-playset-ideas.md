I didn't think I'd have any other set ideas in me, but with Iron & Salt nearing completion, I've had a couple ideas just spring to mind that I might be able to turn into Weave playsets. They'd even be set in the same world as I&S, which is something the Weave folks have been pestering me about.

I'm calling the first idea Hybrids. The idea would be that the human hunters are pushing the monsters to the brink and reasserting their place at the top of the food chain. Faced with extinction, the majority of the monsters have retreated to a sealed off city in a remote location. After a hundred or so years, the monsters have developed a thriving community, but still have to find ways to survive. This is especially difficult for those who require humans as food, such as vampires. There will probably also be sections of the city filled with the monsters that have less control, such as ghosts and zombies. I'm thinking this will combine elements from Zootopia, Hotel Transylvania, and Batman: Arkham City. Due to interspecies courting, there will be very few "pure" specimens left. That means the player elements can be borrowed piecemeal from other monster types. So players will have abilities like "sharp fangs", "shapeshifting", "nightvision", and "seduction" while having flaws like "vulnerable to sunlight", "vulnerable to silver", "bloodlust", or "uncontrolled transformation". I have an opportunity here to come up with an almost completely unique setting with fleshed out locations, NPCs, and governing forces. Including the hundred year time skip also means I'm free to come up with whatever technology I want. A couple of the themes will probably indicate the world outside, such as discovery by the elite hunter squadrons, venturing outside for resources, encountering curious humans, and others. I think this could turn out to be very interesting. I'll keep Hybrids as the working title, and probably name the set after the city.

On the other side of the spectrum, my second idea is called... something. The premise of this one is the opposite of Hybrids, where instead of the humans asserting their dominance, they're losing to the monsters. I'm basing this idea off of the parallel world in Supernatural, where the apocalypse happened, the archangel Michael is in power, and humans spend their days huddled in camps trying to avoid being detected. I suppose I could also go the other way and say that Lucifer won instead. I'm thinking of trying to call this something based on Iron & Salt, but decayed. Something like Rust & Water. It's hard to think of something that represents "rotted salt". Salt doesn't rot or go bad really. It gets dissolved, washed away, or chemically turned into something else. Either way, this is a post-Revelations world. Lucifer and the Four Horsemen came out of a pit, bringing disease, war, and death to the populace. When they looked to Heaven for help, they got.... nothing. Left to fend for themselves in a world that had forsaken them, the humans turned to the hunters. Their last hope was this disorganized group of elite monster killers who tried... and failed, to stem the tide. They broke under Lucifer's heel, and he washed over the world, bathing it in blood and fire. After it was over, Lucifer stood as king of the ashes. He brought Hell to Earth, and now the remaining humans have to figure out how to live in it. I imagine this will not be a humorous playset, but players will probably find humor in it anyway.

So I need a name for this, at least as a working title. Ideas, ideas, ideas....
* Apocalypse After
* Rust & Decay
* The Night Bumped Back
* After the Burn
* After the Fire
* Hell on Earth
* After the End
* Hellscape
* Where is your God now?
* The Hunt is Over

I'll figure it out later.
