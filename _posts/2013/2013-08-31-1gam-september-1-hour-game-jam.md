title: "1GAM September - 1 Hour Game Jam"
category: game development
---
Since I know I'm going to be really busy this month, and I have a long weekend with little to do, I threw this game together in about an hour using GameMaker Studio. It probably has more juice than any of my previous games besides Crypt Crawler, just because I took a little extra time to add some particles and sound effects. It's little more than a simple arcade game, but feel free to head over to the Projects page to check it out.
