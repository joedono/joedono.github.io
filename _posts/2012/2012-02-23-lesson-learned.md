I wanted to share a tenant of game development that I had read about, but never experienced. I released The Great Inkscape into the wild, posted it on a few message boards. The result I got back was pretty shocking. Everyone thought it was too hard. I probably should have realized this when I got my first alpha tester, and she died 8 times before completing the first level, and that was only after I made a few alterations to make it easier.

The lesson here is, if you are developing a game and you think it is just difficult enough, then it is probably WAY too hard. You've been playing this game for weeks (maybe months). You know all the quirks and tricks, most of which are probably not as obvious as you think. You are the *best* player in the world at this game right now. You have no equal, and won't until someone else puts as much exhaustive effort and time into this game as you have.
