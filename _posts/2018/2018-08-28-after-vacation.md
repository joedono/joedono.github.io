This was a vacation that was sorely needed. A week off with my wife and some close friends up at our lakeside cabin. Other than the first day, it was the best week I've had all year.

I have spent an average of one weekend a year up at the cabin. I have a lot of memories from up there and a lot of favorite locations I wanted to share with my friends. Unfortunately, that sentiment was why the first day absolutely sucked. I wanted to bring everyone to my favorite restaurant for dinner. My parents had warned me that it had been bought out by another company, but they described how they didn't like the food there that much, so at least I had hope that we'd at least get to eat there. Not so. Not only was it closed down with all the lights off, but it was also all torn up. Like it was in the middle of being renovated. So that was a big disappointment. We found another nearby restaurant and bar to try. That was our biggest mistake. The place was seedy as hell, especially our table, which we picked because it was right on the water. Our waitress forgot about us a couple times. My wife wanted a cocktail, but didn't have her ID, so she opted for water. She didn't get her water until our food was brought out. One of my friends ordered a Reuben, but there was no Thousand Island dressing on it. Another friend ordered a cheeseburger. It came cut in half and turned up on end. You know how restaurants will sometimes stick a toothpick down the middle of a sandwich or burger with a lot of stuff on it to hold the whole thing together? The chef tried to do that with this burger, but forgot that the burger was standing on end. They stuck the toothpick down into just the meat. It wasn't holding anything together at all. When we were done, we went to the grocery store that was attached to my favorite restaurant. It was under new management, but was actually open. However, the toy store section was closed off and the comic book stand was gone. So there's another crushing blow to my childhood. To top it all off, when we were about 3/4 of the way back to the cabin, my stomach started turning over. I ran inside to the bathroom as soon as the car was off and threw up the macaroni and cheese I had at the stupid restaurant. All in all, a pretty terrible day.

Tuesday was dark and stormy, so we stayed inside and did absolutely nothing. It was amazing.

Wednesday we went out and did an escape room. It was a lot of fun. We solved maybe 80%-85% of the puzzles. Then my wife got to talking shop with the owner and he invited us to his backstage area so we could see what else he was working on. That night, we played drunk Super Mario World. I felt a little left out of the shenanigans, but I'm not too bitter about that.

Thursday we did a hilarious photo shoot on the lake and the last member of our party arrived. We played Red Dragon Inn and Cards Against Humanity that night.

Friday we went to a brewery that had really good pizza. We went out to firespin that night, played Weave, and ended the night playing Billionaire Banshee, which was also a lot of fun.

Saturday we toured a castle and went secret hunting. That night, something really special happened that I'll never forget, but will not put up on the internet.

Sunday, we drove home.

So I had a ton to say about the badness of the first day, and not a lot to say about the rest of the week. To be honest, other than that last night, not a whole lot happened. It was a very relaxing week full of a lot of nothing. We had a lot of fun and came out the other side with no regrets. No regrets except having to come back to work this week.
