Since I'm basically playing Walter White at the beginning of his career in my D&D campaign, I need to have some criminal way to make a whole ton of money, likely by screwing someone else over. We've been introduced to the extremely powerful person who will be our sponsor for a while, fixing our ship and sending us out on errands. My character was slightly apprehensive internally about taking up this deal, but I, the player, pushed it through because I'm pretty sure that the DMs wanted it to happen to give us our ship faster and give them a good way to get us to go out on errands. I'm pretty sure we did the equivalent of being hired by Weyland-Yutani and they're going to start sending us to collect xenomorph samples, but that's for future us to think about.

Right now, my character is turning over ideas in his head for how to get this powerful fellow to part with a sizable chunk of his money and get it into my pockets. I don't know much about him for now other than he's probably the richest man on the pirate island, that everyone likes him, that he pays for a good deal of the "official" partying that goes on here, and he's capable of "disappearing" people who cross him. My style isn't going to be the direct or even the indirect approach. I saw where that got the people who tried to use me as a patsy. No, my methods will be as white collar as they come. Forgery, bluffing, a little extortion or bribery, spying, lots and LOTS of information gathering, and when it's all over, the target won't even know they were a target. They'll just think they were forced to take a somewhat lopsided deal by life circumstances.

So right now is just information gathering. I'm not even sure if the DMs will go for this without me telling them what I'm trying to do. About my only leverage right now is Katalina and the promise that she'll do what I ask her because she has nothing better to do. I haven't really earned her trust. If anything, I've probably trashed it beyond repair. So she'll have to remain tangential to whatever I'm planning. I'll send her to work at the Bank, and ask her to keep an eye out for any large deposits or withdrawals from the big guy's accounts. I'm pretty sure he won't keep all his money in this one Bank, but any window in to his behavior will be good for me right now.

As for myself, I can't do much information gathering without a ship and standing. So those are my first goals. I want to be seen as a person who can be trusted by the majority of the community. So what can I do in my downtime to earn the trust of the majority of the pirates here? Carousing seems like a sure way into their hearts, but it will take a long time and I run the risk of putting myself at their mercy in an effort to earn their friendship instead. No, I need to bring something new to the table. Something that everyone will be glad to have but won't look like competition. I could go straight for the WW route and start a drug trade. Something with a long buildup time, so by the time someone starts showing symptoms of addiction, they are hopelessly addicted already. To that end, I could start learning alchemy. I wonder if that's an official downtime activity.... it is. I could take my time training in Alchemy to create this drug, or other things like it. I could probably think of more stuff, but I think this is what my character would do. He is a student of Transmutation, after all.

What's the next step after that? Do I take the path of turning The Big Stick into a drug trading empire? And where does that put me in relation to parting our sponsor from a sizable share of his money? Do I take the dark route and attempt to turn all the pirates into my drug-addled slaves and then throw him out? Do I really want to become that sort of a mad scientist? Or do I want to use my skills to make the world a better place? I think I'd be most interested in just making a lot of money and buying my way back into my family. Maybe the drug trade will be all I need for that. Let's go with that.

What's next after learning alchemy? I start experimenting on creating a drug that fits certain criteria. It must be addictive and pleasant to use. It must not show any harmful symptoms for at least a month, ideally 2 or 3. It must be able to be ingested through food, drink, or by itself. It must be easy to mass-produce, even if it requires expensive ingredients. It would be helpful if it had some suggestive qualities at first, but it must be easily marketed as a hangover remedy or pain medication or something at first. I suppose it would be helpful to learn what sort of other drugs are in circulation in the city right now too. That'll be another downtime activity.

Another avenue I just thought of is counterfeiting, but I feel like that'd be too easily traced and I'd be too expendable. So complicated drug trade it is.

What do I need?
- Alchemy skills
- Alchemy supplies
- Experimental subjects (animals?)
- Dedicated work space, maybe permanent lodgings?
- Distributors, maybe make something else, like wine, and dissolve the drug in that

What do I do for next session?
- Station Katalina at the bank and keep an eye on any large transactions
- Learn alchemy
- Learn whether there are permanent and private dwellings on the island
- Start learning what the drug trade is like in this world and how much of it comes through this island

Okay, I think I have enough to bring to the DMs.
