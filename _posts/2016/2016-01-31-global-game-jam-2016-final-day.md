title: Global Game Jam 2016 - Final Day
category: game development

Technically, I'm writing this the day after the final day of GGJ, but I'm really bored today and need something to do.

I had a medium amount of fun this year. Not nearly as good as the last time I went. I don't feel like I grew as a developer at all this year. I guess that can be expected. I didn't try anything crazy, I didn't push myself, I worked alone, and I went with a safe idea in an engine that I'm really comfortable in. It didn't help that all the participants were students. A few were more disciplined than others, but most were pretty unprofessional. Which is to be completely expected. I just couldn't help wondering if another site would fit me a little better. Unfortuately, there aren't any other sites that can compare to this one in terms of convenience. Any other site would either require me to drive for a few hours to get there and/or have me staying in a hotel for the weekend. Or on-site if allowed. Although I'd like to avoid that.

I've added my game to the Projects page. I built it in LÃ–VE, so you'll need to download that from [the website](http://www.love2d.org/) to play it.

I know what I'm going to do this year though. I'm going to really buckle down and spend the year learning Unity. I saw what people were able to throw together over a weekend and how comfortable they were throwing around vocabulary I didn't really know. I've been meaning to learn how to use Unity since 2012, I just kept stalling after getting through a few tutorials. It doesn't help that I keep telling myself that I don't have the mind to come up with good 3D game ideas. I can think of a ton of simple 2D game concepts that a solo, hobby-ist developer could accomplish. I can't do that with 3D. Maybe I'm not giving the engine enough credit. At least, if I tried building a 2D platformer in Unity, it'd be like using an actual level editor rather than Tiled or text config files. I'd actually be able to see and fly around the level as I'm building it.

So, two new year's resolutions for 2016. Get in shape and lose the gut, and learn Unity.
