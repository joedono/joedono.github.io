title: "1GAM December - Snake Catcher"
category: game development

I owe my wife for the idea to this game. I can usually count on her to come up with some random little idea that I can turn into something pretty easily. My entry for 1GAM December is Snake Catcher. It seems fitting that my last entry is a 2D arcade game with a simple concept. That seems to be what comes easiest to me. Check it out on my Projects page.
