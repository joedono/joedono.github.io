Ugh...yeah, that's right. I'm actually approaching midterms time this late in the year. It's hard to believe that my semester is already almost half over. It's been fun so far, and I think I'm starting to get used to conversing in Japanese more.

I have an 8-page presentation on Western Religion and Colonialism in China due on Thursday, and I have four quizzes in Japanese this week, then the midterms start. It'll leave me ready to be as social as possible afterward. Wish me luck!

P.S. If anyone knows where I can find a good timeline of western colonialism in China, that'll be very helpful. I have nearly all the information I need regarding the missions, but nothing on secular colonies.
