This will mark the first time that I'm posting to this blog during the evening, but my most recent change required things that I could only really get access to at home. This is partly an experiment to see how high my number is and partly just to have everything in one place. I have compiled a list of all the projects I've "finished" since I started building games in my spare time. So, I've added a Projects page to the site and filled it with links to all my "finished" projects.

The total is a whopping 33 games.

Now, some of these could be classified as tech demos or proof-of-concepts. If we remove those, we're left with...maybe 25 or so. The criteria for that is kind of vague here. But it's still a pretty high number. None of these games have a high level of polish, I think. But they're mostly bug-free and have clear concepts. I even have a 3D game in there. It was made using ZGameEditor and is *extremely* simple, but still...

So I'm pretty proud of my game dev history. For a single developer working a full-time job, this isn't bad. I think the first game on here, I built in 2009 or 2010. So around 30 small games in 5 years isn't bad at all. And this is of course not counting all the false starts and other big ideas I've had over the years.

Of course, at some point, I'd like to build for a platform that will let me make a little money off of one of these. Since I'm alone, I'm probably limited to mobile or browser-based games. Despite that, I want to stick with my library of choice: LÖVE. Only one game on my Projects page is built in LÖVE, and I think it's one of the most fleshed out games on there. Crypt Crawler is also the only game on that list currently where I *didn't* work alone on it. I had a great artist helping me out at no charge.

Anyway, maybe I'll go start that MetroidVania game sometime this weekend. I'm going to have a lot of spare time, now that my freelancing assignment is done for a while.
