Back in January, I attended Global Game Jam 2013. In the course of working on our entry (Ventricle Assault), there was a point where my team collectively just sat and stared at our game. We had just added the background to the main play area. We realized then that we were making a real game. Our...thing, had stopped being just a bunch of shapes shooting at each other and looked like something we'd find on the shelf in a game store (in the 80s, but still made by people paid to make it).

I tell  you this because I just went through a similar experience with Crypt Crawler. My artist has turned Crypt Crawler into something that resembles an actual game. I now have to struggle not to have too much fun playtesting so that I can keep developing.
