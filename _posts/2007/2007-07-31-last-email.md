Well...this is it. It's currently 10:15 on my last night in Japan. I leave tomorrow morning for the airport and my flight leaves at 4pm. According to my itinerary, that puts me at JFK airport in New York at 6:23pm, although I'm not sure about the date on that. I've finished packing everything, and it all just barely fits. I sent one last small package home just to make sure everything fit. I've cancelled my cell phone (although they're letting me keep the phone) and had my room inspected.

I've spent the last hour surfing the internet, looking at old cartoons and feeling nostalgic. I don't think I've ever sighed so much in one day. Just walking around town made me depressed. I'll miss the nightly runs to the convenience store and the melon soda, but I know I want to be home, drinking root beer and eating scrambled eggs. It's been the adventure of a lifetime and I'm glad you all got to share it with me. I'll be looking forward to seeing everyone again and sharing my story. I'll expect to hear what you've all been doing these past four months as well.
