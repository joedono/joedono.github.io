title: "Project Page Revamp"

I've just finished revamping my Projects page to better facilitate more projects. I remember I was going to upload a bunch of my old Java Applet games, but putting all those games and their summaries on one page was going to make the page real big real fast. So I've broken each project off onto their own page and made the main Projects page more of a mosaic of title screens. I think it looks a lot better, mis-matched column heights aside.
