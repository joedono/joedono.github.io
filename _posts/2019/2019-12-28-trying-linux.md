title: Trying Linux

A couple years ago, I realized that I needed a laptop for the few times when I'm away from my home or work computer and some emergency happens. I need a way to make code edits to the site I volunteer for and to remote into work when some emergency happens there. So I bought a tiny 32GB laptop, thinking that would be plenty. Little did I know that the modern Windows OS (either 7 or 10, I forget which I got) would take up 29 of those GB. Now the remaining 3GB is plenty for me to do the emergency work. I only need Git, a text editor, and an FTP client, but I wanted a little more. I wanted to install Love, Node, and Rails so I could work on my personal projects too. Then I noticed that whenever I booted up the laptop, the hard drive space would just....disappear. Then I'd get a notice that the laptop didn't have enough hard drive space to download the Windows updates. Not to mention that the computer ran suuuuper slowly.

This weekend, I resolved to do something about it. I Googled "tiny linux" and got to work. 24 hours later, I'm writing this post from my new Bodhi installation and I'm pleasantly surprised at how fast my laptop has become. The change made me go from less than a GB of free space to 19GB of free space. I'm operating at the bare minimum right now. I've got my Git, FTP client, and text editor. Today, I get to try out installing my other hobby software.

I'm reasonably satisfied with Bodhi. It has a lot of issues with installing things. There are two different package installers: The Bodhi App Center and gDebi. gDebi has issues with crashing without saying anything. I had some issues installing a Git GUI too. I'm used to GitHub for Windows, which obviously won't work here. I tried out GitKraken, but you have to pay for that if you want to use it for private repositories. Then I remembered that Atom, my preferred text editor, has a rudimentary Git GUI built into it. I just had to install git on its own (no problems there) and everything else would work out just fine.

So, it's taken a bit of getting used to, but once I get everything set up, I don't expect there will be much difference between this and my normal Windows experience.

I did have to install the part of the Settings app that lets me uninstall packages from a GUI though. That was a bit of a trip.
