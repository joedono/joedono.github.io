Once more, I am pleasantly surprised by the toolet I am using. I was prepared to spend this entire weekend building growing moving platforms. I've tried to implement moving platforms in the past, and normally, they are one of the most difficult pieces of platforming. However, with Flixel, nearly all the work is already done. A quick call to the right collision-checker, and almost all cases are taken care of. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell through these screenshots, but I'm not up for posting videos just yet.
