I finished up Paranoia Agent.

It turns out that I had already seen about half of it during its original run on Toonami. However, I didn't think I had seen the best parts of the story in that sampling. The story is wrapped up really nicely, but there are parts that I wish would receive more emphasis. I love stories where the attention and fear of a populace creates menaces for the main cast. It's the whole point of the Melty Blood story and gives good reason for the characters' evil alter egos to appear alongside the characters themselves. It's even cooler when the manifestations are actually aware of the source of their existance.

The biggest disappointment was that the reason the original Maromi died is not actually explained. Kon shows Tsukiko collapsing into a crouch like she has a stomachache and letting go of the leash, but then she stands up like nothing happened and reacts in fear when she finds Maromi dead in the street. I suppose we're meant to think that she was always a little insane, but even a kid would react to a sudden stomachache more than that.

The other thing I'm disappointed in is the treatment of Little Slugger in the last few episodes. I'll buy that he's getting more powerful as the people's fear grows, but I really didn't like how that was portrayed. He got bigger, grew fangs, and had glowing red eyes. He was accompanied by this weird shadow-mass that was eating up all the people, but a more gradual increase in power and a better portrayal of the the last fight might have been better. It is Kon, so I suppose I can give the fanciful world-bending a pass.

I think I know what it was. After the two detectives investigating the case lose their jobs, we watch an episode or two of completely unrelated characters. Then, there's a "some time later" cut, and the two detectives are established in other jobs: one as a security guard and the other as a vigilante. There's nothing in that establishing episode to suggest that Little Slugger has gotten any more powerful. There have been no more attacks mentioned, there's no curfew, many people seem to know that he attacks people who are "emotionally cornered" but no therapy or thought policing has been set up. Society just continued to function as normal until the vigilante detective finds Little Slugger and helps defeat him.

Whatever. It started off real strong and ended in a way fitting a story about rumors gaining power should. Now on to Flame of Recca.
