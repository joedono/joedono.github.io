Here we are, at the finish line. 12 months and 12 games after I said to myself "This is it. This will be my New Year's Resolution for 2013." I was never big on the whole New Year's Resolution thing. I get that the new year is special, but you shouldn't wait for a specific time of year to try to make yourself better. That's probably why none of my older resolutions ever worked out. I guess that means this was the first resolution I actually cared about and wanted to see through.

Not much else happened this year other than my marriage (which is, by no means, a small event), so 1GAM has a secure place in my memory of 2013. I think my game dev skills have come pretty far since January. Although that's to be expected. Even if you count all of my older projects, I've doubled my game development portfolio and gained experience working with more engines than I care to admit. I've worked with a team and a partner for the first time too.

My original goal was not just to finish 12 games in 12 months. I had spent more time collecting game engines and reading about the latest and greatest techniques than I had actually <i>using</i> any of those tools. So I wanted to take the first two weeks of each month to learn a new engine and spend the last two weeks actually building a game. Here's where that ended up:

* January - Gamemaker 8.0
* February - XNA
* March - Love2D
* April - Stencyl
* May - Flixel
* June - LimeJS
* July - Gamemaker Studio
* August - Haaf's Game Engine
* September - Gamemaker Studio
* October - ZGameEditor
* November - Gamemaker Studio
* December - Gamemaker Studio

I am a little disappointed in myself that I let my secondary goal trickle off at the end. That's 4 months that I caved and went back to Gamemaker Studio just for its ease of use and my ability to quickly throw together games with it. I knew I wouldn't have enough projects for everything, but I had originally wanted to work with RPGMaker VX Ace, DreemChest, MonoGame, Sphere, Allegro, SDL, PyGame, Unity, and the Unreal Engine.

My other regret from this year was not participating in more of the community events that happened around 1GAM or that I was invited to because of 1GAM. Even with 12 opportunities, I never did participate in the 1GAM-CRUNCH, the last-minute game jam that happened during the last weekend of each month. I didn't participate in any other jams for that matter. During March and April, I was receiving invites to Google+ Hangouts to talk about developments in the industry like the Ouya and Oculus Rift, and about how other independent and hobbyist game devs organize their projects and stay motivated. I did attend the Global Game Jam 2013 and I fully intend to go in 2014, so there's that.

I do not plan on participating in 1GAM for 2014, although I've read that the event will continue. I have been approached and asked to work on another gamedev project that will likely take up a lot of my time. Especially considering that it looks like the beginning of a full-fledged indie game studio. However, I will keep track of developments on the 1GAM site. I imagine it will keep getting bigger and more interesting and that more and more people will find their place in game development.

I want to thank my wife for supporting me when I wanted to stop participating (which, admittedly, wasn't very often) and for giving me ideas when my own creative juices had run out. I want to thank GGJ for helping me kick my 1GAM off right. I want to thank VirgiliArt for his contribution to my March 1GAM Project (I still think it's the best game I built this year). Finally, I want to thank @McFunkyPants for creating this incredible event, for being so dedicated to it, and for giving me some personal encouragement when I was the top-scorer for a week and thought it must have been a bug in the system.

This has been an amazing year!! See you all in 2014!!!
