I'm working on my first multi-day sketch. It was going to be for Inktober day 8 "Frail", but I missed that. My subject isn't frail by any means, but her name is Freya, which sort of sounds like "frail." She's easily my most complicated drawing yet. I'm doing the beast character from Final Fantasy IX, not the Greek goddess.

This is the pose I'm doing, but I have a 2D cartoon version of it. Lately, I've been drawing reference lines using the photo on my phone to get the proportions right, but that's left me with relatively tiny images. This time, I actually measured my phone screen and my canvas and did a bit of math to get the proportions right. My wife scolded me for "bringing math into my art." Hehe.

So far, I've done the basic shapes and the rough sketch outline of everything, and I've done the "final" outline of Freya's hat. Superman pushed me reasonably far through my limits. Then I did Freeze Man, which was even more detailed. This is going to blow both of them out of the water. It'll be my most complex character yet. I need to figure out where I go from here.
