title: Spellcasting as Deckbuilding

I have to get this out of my head before it explodes. One of my D&D players and I had a partial conversation that tried to compare spellcasting in D&D 5e to deckbuilding games. I turned this concept over and over in my head and I think I've got it nailed down. I just want to write it out so it can stop living in my head.

Spellcasting in D&D, as expressed in terms of deckbuilding games, has 5 parts:
1. The Store
2. The Deck
3. The Hand
4. The Slots
5. The Freebies

Every class in D&D uses these parts slightly differently. They function as follows:
1. The Store represents all of the spells your character could possibly learn and cast at a given level
2. The Deck represents all of the spells your character knows
3. The Hand represents all of the spells your character has prepared for a given day
4. The Slots represent the resources you have to spend in order to cast a spell
5. The Freebies are a side resource that represent your Cantrips

For the Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, every 2-4 level ups, they gain access to a new set of spells. The Store is immediately stocked with fresh spells of the new level, and they all immediately purchase copies of those spells and add them to their Deck. At the beginning of an adventuring day, they are able to take a certain number of the spells in their Deck and add them to their Hand. Throughout the day, they are able to spend Slots to play the spells in their hands. At the end of the day, when the player takes a long rest, their Slots all refresh, and they are able to draw a new Hand if they like.

For the Bard, Warlock, Sorceror, Ranger, Wizard, every 2-4 level ups, the Store is also immediately stocked with fresh spells of the new level, if appropriate. The difference is that they can only buy a couple of those spells from the Store to add to their Deck each level. For Bard, Warlock, Sorceror, and Ranger, they draw their entire Deck into their Hand at the beginning of each adventuring day. The Wizard has to pick and choose, as they are likely to have a lower maximum Hand size than the number of cards in their Deck.

A lot of these classes have things that make them special in terms of their spellcasting.

For Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, and Paladin, it's the types of spells they have access to. Cleric and Paladin have more access to healing or Radient themed spells. Druid has more access to natural and environmental spells. Bard has more access to crowd control, manipulation, and support spells.

For Warlock, they only ever have 2-3 Slots total, but they're all at max level and they refresh on a Short Rest as well as a Long Rest.

For Sorceror, they have additional resources, called Metamagic, that lets them cast spells with special modifiers, such as copying the spell or casting it around allies.

For Wizard, they are the only class (other than special Warlocks) who can learn spells outside of leveling up. All other spellcasters are only able to buy new spells from the Store to add to their Deck when they level up. The Wizard is able to add spells to his Deck that he finds in spell scrolls or other spellbooks while adventuring. This potentially allows the Wizard to have the biggest and most varied Deck of any spellcaster.
