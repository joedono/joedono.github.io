So I completed enough of Wizard Plumber to bring it home and release it for my alpha testers (read: tester...singular). The basic point of this game is to rotate the pipes on screen to get the water from the emitters to the receivers. I will probably have a better name for those down the line. The gimmick is that you can draw a line across a stream of water and create a "Magic Pipe" that will redirect the water in the direction you draw the line. Currently, the game is restricted to the water moving at right angles. The puzzles aren't that hard at the moment. They either need a redone concept, or a better level designer then me.

In the gameplay screenshots, the red boxes are the emitters, the green boxes that fill up with yellow are the receivers, the gray pipes are the normal pipes that are placed when the level starts and can be rotated, the orange pipes are "Magic Pipes", and the blue particles are...water. Duh.

I'm trying to keep the controls in this game as simple as possible. Currently, the whole game is played with the right mouse button and click-and-drag. I'm thinking that, once I get a good concept and awesome levels ironed out, this will be easily ported to a touch-screen mobile platform.
