title: Should I Leave?

I'm not sure if this should have been a Rant page. I'm working through a decision in my gaming.

I came back to FFXIV for the Shadowbringers release. I worked my way through it, far more slowly than I normally would have. I was enjoying myself for a while, just playing through the story and only occasionally watching my friends play. They were much farther behind me in the story, so I was happy to help them out from time to time.

Then life happened and all of them stopped playing. I transferred servers, left my old guild, and joined theirs. They lasted for maybe a month and then all just stopped playing. My wife tells me that it's because they were spending all their time working the renaissance faire season, which held water until two weeks ago, when the season ended and I still never saw anyone online. I'm strongly debating leaving the guild and joining another one. I took an interest in the guild workshop projects, but those are stalled until I can get three other members online at the same time. That seriously hasn't happened at all in two months. Three members!

I'm honestly not mad that they left. I don't think I play at weird hours. I play for an hour or two between 6am and 8am (which is weird), but then I play most nights between 9:30 and 11:00. When I was with my old guild, that was peak playing time. It still seems to be peak playing time for the rest of the server too. I'm still not mad. They all work weird shift jobs or have other life problems to deal with. What I am mad about is that I have been convinced to stay with them for "just a little while longer" and wait until they hopefully come back online. It's just so lonely playing an MMO by myself most of the time...

I just... I don't know what's stopping me. It's probably just that my wife is in this guild. But she hardly ever plays either. And we're totally different gamers. I just took a look through our membership, and I'm the highest level crafter in the guild. That's not saying very much, but I expected a little more. I'm not asking them to drop their lives and come form a community just for me. I'm not expecting them to log on and ask me what I want to do with them. I want to be able to log on and have a community of people I can interact with. I want to get to know other people on this server. I want to be social!! I want to go back to what I had in my previous guilds, where I could log on, say hello in FC chat, and get some responses back, maybe join in a conversation. I want to have an airship again, or a garden, or a chocobo stable. I want to log on when a new patch comes out and have people to enjoy the content with. I wanted to go through the Halloween event with other people. I want to rave about the Rising events and the Moonfire Faire events. I want to PLAY THE GAME!!!

The solution is so obvious. Just leave and join another one. If I'm going to do that, I need to do it before I invest too much in my personal room.

Who am I kidding? I know that won't happen for a long time. I might just be desperate enough for in-game contact that I'm willing to be satisfied with making my wife a giant fish tank and some music for a while. I'm like a starving puppy being satisfied with occasional scraps, and I can't stop it. Hope springs eternal. I don't even want to give this a time limit. Like, "I'll give them until the end of November before I give up on them." Because I'm worried that waiting that long will just destroy my enjoyment of the game.

So I'm going to open a conversation with them and see where their lives are. If they're playing at weird times, I'll try to adjust. If I can't adjust or they're not playing, I'll look for my socialization elsewhere.
