Once upon a time, I had my own personal website: http://www.littlehivestudios.com.

Unfortunately, my site design was pretty terrible and I found better tools to get my word out to the great internet (ie, Blogger), so the domain is now defunct and has been sent back into the ether for anyone to pick up.

However, that also means I have a lot of content that is just going to waste. You know how I've been saying for a long time that I only have one finished game under my belt? That's not entirely true. I actually have more than 20 "finished" games under my belt. Now, I should mention that at least 12 of these games are practically direct copies of classic games. I, like most other aspiring game developers, cloned Minesweeper, Tetris, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, to name a few. The other 10 or so games are original ideas. Well, they're original in that I came up with them without outside inspiration.

What this means for you, my reader, is that I am working on a page for this blog that will have links to all my projects, screenshots, and a little synopsis for each game. This will be a bit of an undertaking, as these games have been built for in-browser play and I'm not sure Blogger would appreciate it if I tried hosting them here.

Ah, well, whatever. We'll see what the new Projects page actually looks like when it's finished someday.
