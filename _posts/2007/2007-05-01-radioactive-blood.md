puff, puff, wheeze, puff, puff, wheeze...ok, so...um, yeah, awesome movie.

Had a vocab quiz this morning. I think I did pretty good. Jumped from group to group just kinda hanging out until 4:00. Actually had to take a friend to the infirmary. She (her name's Camille) has problems with her ankles and one of them swelled up on her this afternoon. So I brought her to the infirmary where they don't speak any English. We stumbled through our conversations a bit until a bilingual student offered to help. The infirmary couldn't do anything for her, so they gave us a map of the nearest health clinic and she decided that she had taken up enough of my time and insisted that she go alone. I E-mailed her about 2 hours later, and she's fine, but it was still an interesting experience.

At 4 I went to the library and tried to do homework, but I fell asleep until 4:50. As I was walking out to meet with friends, I saw one of the people I was supposed to be going with. He was engrossed in studying and I was afraid he might miss the meeting time without getting a chance to eat anything. He was pretty thankful that I showed up to remind him about the necessities of being human.

Then we went to the movie...yeah. It was awesome. The movie was in English with Japanese subtitles. We got a big kick out of this one line that Jameson says "What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year?" I couldn't read the subtitles all that well, but that's definitely not what they said.

This is the part where I point and laugh at all the people who have to wait 3 more days before seeing it...ie all of you...ahem...

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! *smirk*

Ok, I'm done. But seriously, go see it. It is quite amazing. I don't think it's true to any one storyline in particular. The directors took a lot of creative liberties, but if you get past that whole "Hey! That wasn't how it happened!" then the movie is totally awesome and well worth the plans, long waits, and ticket prices that we all have to endure at some point.

Final Thought: GO SEE IT!!
