Alright, gang! Brainstorming time!! We're here to come up with 3-4 extremely basic themes or pitches or summaries of potential early stage campaigns that I can send my players through.

The title I picked for this post reminded me of the game I heard of, "The Guild of Dungeoneering." I suppose that might be fun, if these guys were just in a guild of adventurers sent out on...stuff. I'll probably stick that in my back pocket as the sort of last ditch effort. There are still a lot of things I can do with this though. Fairy Tale was really entertaining in the beginning, with rival adventuring guilds, heritage issues, new members to be mentored, disasters for the city, tournaments, etc.

I always wanted to do a "we can't really do anything but survive this disaster" adventure. I really **really** want to put the Tarrasque into an adventure one day, as a sort of living natural disaster that the players have to survive. That's much more of a high level campaign scenario though. Definitely not suited for level 1-3 characters.

I could resurrect the campaign idea I had for Sal's bachelor party. I still have the notes from that. I'd have to update that for 5e and a party of level 1 characters. It was also designed to be a one-shot, so I'll have to extend it quite a bit.

I'm not sure I'm on the right track with these ideas, at least I think that only one of the above is actually the flavor I'm looking to construct and pitch. So what else can I come up with for initial "pitch ideas"?

1. Newbie adventurers joining a guild of adventuring in a city with many such guilds who compete for jobs and money and fame and stuff. Mercenary.
2. Covert heist-style endeavor where each member of the party was sought out by a client to accomplish an under-the-table task, such as steal something back from a villain. Heist.
3. Cultist attack on the city by summoning a large beastie or natural disaster. Stop the ritual. Investigation.
4. Hired by the king to rescue the princess. Generic, but could be open to clever plot twists. Rescue.
5. Prison escape out into a destroyed world, a la 28 Days Later.

I think that's good enough to start with. I'll flesh out what the first hour of each one will look like so we can play through that during our Session 0. Or I'll improvise it, hehehe
