Previous to this, I've tried my hand at numerous other smaller games. Most of them have been written in Java and I would hesitate to call any of them "finished". I have discovered a two major issues with my development process.<br />First, I'm unwilling to throw out and redesign big sections of code. In one of my earlier attempts at a MetroidVania games, I was finished with the engine and ready to start building levels when I realized that I needed to add a feature. I needed to add the ability for the player to receive messages on screen and not be able to move while reading them. I was unwilling to redesign my Player class to add this feature. I ended up scrapping the project and moving on.<br />Second, related to the first, I end up planning too much and getting bogged down in engine coding. As you can see above, I "finished" building the engine before working on the actual game.

Not this time! I'm keeping my mind open to the idea that my code now will look completely different when I'm finished and I'm writing new features as I need them, no matter what I have to redesign.
