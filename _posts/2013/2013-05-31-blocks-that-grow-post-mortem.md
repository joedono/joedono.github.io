It...is...accomplished!!! I've never appreciated tight deadlines like I have with this project. I banged out the bulk of the features in the past 2 days and had to cut more corners than I have on any other project. Right now, I'm so glad this is done. Blocks that Grow is finished. You can check it out on the Projects page.

<b>What went right</b>
The tools. I haven't built a game in a coding tool with code completion since February, and I missed it. Flixel is definitely a library I will use again. A big chunk of the game involves the player being pushed around by the moving/growing platforms. I was not looking forward to writing that stuff all over again. Turned out, Flixel handled that out of the box. I was able to bang that out in an hour. And FlashDevelop was incredible for a free tool. I highly recommend this toolset to anyone.

The deployment. I keep asking myself why I didn't pick up Flash sooner. The fact that I can build a game, put it online, and anyone can play it regardless of platform is astounding. I know Flash is starting to lose ground to HTML5, but I don't see it disappearing anytime soon.

<b>What went wrong</b>
Honestly, the only thing that went wrong this month was life getting in my way. I had 2 weekends this month where I wasn't near a computer. That's a lot of lost development time. If my idea had been any more complicated, I don't think I would have finished. I don't think I have any other months this year that will be this hectic.

<b>The Future</b>
So, it was a pretty good month. I'm starting to feel the drag. It's getting hard to keep motivated month-to-month. I blame the long break I took last month, but I think it was necessary. I still have a good number of toolsets to try out this year.

* MonoGame
* HTML5
* C++ and SDL or Haaf's
* RPGMaker VX Ace
* GameMaker Studio Professional
* DreemChest

So that's...3 strict coding libraries, 2 game builders, and 1 builder with a heavy scripting component. I'll probably do what I did this month and hold off on choosing an idea and a toolset until I get the optional 1GAM theme and let the inspiration come naturally. The good news is that, other than RPGMaker, I am pretty confidant that I can build whatever I want with any of the other engines. DreemChest is Lua based, which I got my fill of in March with Crypt Crawler. I've worked extensively with GameMaker before (built my very first complete game in it). C++ is the only language there I've never worked with. So it's going to be an interesting year.
