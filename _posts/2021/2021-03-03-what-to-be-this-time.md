It's that time again! GenCon is having a spring showcase this weekend, which means community events, which means I signed up for another D&D one shot, which means I need to come up with another character!

The one-shot is going to have our characters at level 5, which means I get a free pass to play around with a slightly more advanced character than I've ever played before. The highest I ever got a character was Gol-Havel, my monk. Since then, I've played a wizard, barbarian, paladin, warlock, monk, cleric, ranger, and rogue. Unfortunately, my highest was Monk at level 8 (I think), followed by Wizard at level 5. The rest have been stuck at levels 2 or 3. I suppose that means basically anything goes except barbarian and warlock, which are in semi-long-running campaigns already.

So, do I go with something I've played already and want to experience at 5th level or do I go with something brand new? When I first signed up for this, I thought for sure that I'd go with a sorcerer. I'm not really interested in the Artificer or Blood Hunter. What to do, what to do? Looks like most of the classes get really interesting things at 6th level. I'm not sure if I want to play a spellcaster... I still haven't actually played a fighter. Maybe I'll go with that.

Let's go with deciding a character bio first. I'll start as a Halfling, I've never played one of those before. I was thinking about modeling my character after Gilderoy Lockheart or Neon: bubbly, but arrogant and extremely rude. Garret Goodbarrel? Garret Grapevine. That's the one. Garret left home because he thought he had outgrown it and wanted to make his adventures into reality. He's already had countless (mostly fake) adventures so far. He'll be entirely willing to throw himself into a fight or danger until he actually gets hurt, then his inexperience and a little cowardice come out. He thinks everyone should already know who he is, which probably means Folk Hero background. I'll go with Stout Halfling, since the only other subrace that might fit this personality is Lightfoot, which seems to only be useful if I go Rogue.

So, Garret Grapevine, the arrogant self-styled adventurer who's actually proven himself on shockingly many adventures, although he'll claim that the number is far higher. The obvious choice for a character like this is Bard. Let's start with that and see where it goes.

Hmm, the notes for the session list roleplay as Medium and Combat/Tactics as High. I'm starting to think that Bard was a poor choice. I'm seeing a lot of roleplay utility, but not a lot of combat utility unless the rest of my party has high combat utility. I think I'm going to go with something else. I also forgot that, since I'm creating this character on my own, I don't have access to all the crazy sourcebooks that I do when playing in my other campaigns. So, it's just stuff from the PHB for me.

Let's try Druid. That seems to be working out fine.
