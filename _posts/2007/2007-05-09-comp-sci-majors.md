title: School Doesn't Like Computer Science Majors

So I found out a couple days ago that the Computer Science Dept (my major) has decided that there aren't enough people signed up for one of the classes I registered for next semester. So they cancelled it. I can understand why they did it, and the head of the department has contacted me and assured me that they'll be offering it next semester.

Then yesterday, he emailed me again and told me that the only other major course I was signed up for next semester has been cancelled. This is getting ridiculous! I already have to transfer credit from a course that I will (hopefully) be taking next Spring at Sacred Heart because I'm missing my last chance to take it to be in Japan, Now I'm going to have to hope to God that either they don't cancel the course for next semester, or that all the courses I'll need to take don't conflict with each other next spring. Fortunately, when I get back from Japan (provided that all my credits transfer), I'll only have to take 5 more courses to graduate with a BS in Computer Science, which is what I'm used to taking per semester anyway. I have the signatures of approval from the person in charge of the Arts & Sciences dept. transfer credit, so that shouldn't be a problem.

I had heard talk that my school was going to drop the Computer Science dept all together, but I was guaranteed that I would still get a degree because I'm so far into the program already. I'm probably just catching the last leg of it. The head of the dept has assured me that "he will make sure [I am] not screwed over because of this." That is a direct quote from one of his emails, and I've checked his name in the database of my school faculty, so I know at least his position is real. This is totally not what I needed.

I emailed the dean of the A&S dept at Sacred Heart University so that, if all else fails, I might be able to take some courses there next semester. It's not very likely to work on such short notice (spring semester is another matter, it'll be better) but it's only a back-up plan for now.

I know that a couple of people who get this have good reason to despise my school a lot more than I do. I just wanted to rant about it for a bit.

In other news, I missed the sign-ups war for the club rooms. I ended up in the lunchroom hanging out with friends. We went to Akihabara and I bought Fate/ZERO Vol. 2. I really need to start reading it. It's an entire book in Japanese, and I only know the gist of the story, so it'll probably take me quite a while, but it'll be amazing practice.

I have a meeting time and place for the Asakusa tour that Amity Club is putting on Saturday, and I'll be sure not to miss it this time.
