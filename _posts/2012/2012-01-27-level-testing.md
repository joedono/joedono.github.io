Levels 1-5 (all of them) have been platform tested, meaning I went through them in debug mode to make sure it was physically possible to get the character to the end. Levels 1-4 have been ink-tested, meaning I went through them without debug mode to make sure the player could use ink to navigate them. Once I go back and add enemies, checkpoints, and messages and throw together a credits screen, the game will be pretty much done and ready for alpha testing.

I haven't decided on a story for this game yet. I'm probably going to rely on the messages to tell it. The biggest issue with coming up with a story is the lack of a setting to help tell it. There are no set pieces in a game like this. The player has no sense of the type of place they're navigating. I have played a few games that took place in extremely minimalistic environments. They took place in spaceships or test chambers. Maybe I'll go the spaceship route.

In the meantime, here is set of before-and-after screenshots of my Controls screen. That is, before and after my primary tester got a look at it. She was right, the second screen is much less confusing.
