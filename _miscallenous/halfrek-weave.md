Halfrek was born in a colony on Io, a highly volcanic moon of Jupiter. He grew up working as a fuel engineer, planning, diverting, and maintaining Io’s natural magma flows to power the planet’s thermal power stations. His grandfather would tell him stories about his ancestor who was there during humanity’s first and only interaction with an alien life form.

Halfrek developed an obsession with alien life and technology. An obsession so great that Halfrek spent every spare credit and minute scrounging together enough materials to build his own shuttle. During a test flight, Halfrek was caught in a storm, his ship was struck by lightning, and he crashed into a remote region of Io. When he woke up, Halfrek was alone and cold, but with a new ability. Halfrek had become an arc-caster, able to shape and control electricity. After a year stranded in the cold middle of nowhere, Halfrek finally made his way to the nearest colony. He swore he would never be without fire or warmth again.

Undeterred in his obsession, Halfrek knew he could not obtain all the necessary materials to build a ship by himself. Halfrek moved to Thaleia city in Jupiter’s orbit and started making money by busking. With his knowledge of thermal energy and newfound electric abilities, Halfrek made a killing entertaining passer-bys with elaborate light shows. A visiting dignitary fell in love with Halfrek’s show. She took him on as her court jester and magician.

Halfrek kept his goal in mind. He saved and saved until he could afford a ship that could make the journey beyond the solar system. The void was calling. After enhancing his ship with some alien tech he had obtained, Halfrek made it all the way into the Oort Cloud beyond Pluto. Darkness swallowed Halfrek’s ship. All the stars vanished. There was no noise, and all the sensors went quiet. Then the ship started to shake, the sensors started screaming about hull breaches, and everything went black. The next thing Halfrek remembers is waking up in orbit of Neptune. The only active systems were life support and the emergency beacon.

Over the next few days, Halfrek discovered that the Oort Cloud, and whatever was out there, had changed him. He had lost some of his physical connection to this reality and gained the ability to become immaterial. He could feel the power of the dark void around him. It had followed him back into the solar system. He could occasionally manifest it in this reality, but more often, it just came whenever it wanted. Halfrek knew it was following him. He didn’t know how he had escaped, but he knew it wanted him back. The last thing Halfrek wanted was to get caught again. The problem was, you could never tell when the void was waiting in the darkness, just out of sight. And it was always hungry.

Wherever the aliens came from, Halfrek now knew, with more certainty than ever, that it was from beyond the edge of the solar system. The problem now was, how was he ever going to muster the courage to face whatever lived in the darkness of the Oort Cloud again?

## Backstory

### Prized Court Magician

Not all Arc-casters belong to agencies or schools. You have found yourself in the service of a monarch on a small colony world. He values your so-called magic and utilizes you to impress  guests and to intimidate his enemies. He also believes that you can divine the future, an ability which you have never actually had.

### Brilliant idea for a Natural Fuel Source

You've done it! You've discovered a new, clean, truly unlimited source of energy. You haven't actually created a prototype of this revolutionary energy source, but the plans are all there in your head. You could make a fortune off this knowledge. Alternatively, the thermal corporations might simply kill you to keep you from destroying their carefully manufactured economy.

### Descendent of a witness to the Wanderer

Your ancestors saw the Wanderer directly. They were there on Ganymede when the alien vessel arrived. Your grandfather used to tell you stories of his great grandfather's experience, to the point where the Wanderer has become something of a legend. You like to hope that, if the Wanderer ever returns, you will have the fortune of reliving your family's legacy.

### Touched by the Interstellar Medium

The energy in the blackness between the stars seeps in every now and then, and you felt it. It caresses you with fingers of darkness, and left something inside of you. You feel it all the time. A deep awareness of everything around you. A sense of wholeness, of power. It's a hunger that grows.

## Talents

### Arc-casters

You are proficient with utilizes your storm-based powers for offense. You can hurl bolts of charged particles, and generate miniature lightning storms.

### Phaser

You can become like the nebula at will, shifting your physical form into an incorporeal state that allows you to pass through walls and other solid objects.

### Pyrotechnician

The flow of magma on Io requires a very steady, disciplined hand. You possess the devices and skill necessary to direct flames, beams of energy, and other emissions of intense heat. You've utilized this ability in an industrial setting, but hypothetically you would be quite proficient with using it in a combat situation, as well.

### Open Minded

For too long has our species only viewed things through our own lens. Clearly with the existence of aliens, one must accept a broader perspective. You have the ability to accept and adapt to new cultures, places, people, and even frames of reality. Your level-headedness and expanded worldview allow you to deal with strange people easier and survive in rough climates more efficiently.

### Master of Alien Tech

Ever since the arrival of the Wanderer, scientists have attempted to understand and emulate its strange technology. You possess an understanding of the results of this research and reverse-engineering, what little of it there may be. You also have access to advanced technology.

### Gift of Dusk

The weird energies of the interstellar medium beyond the Oort Cloud have transformed you. You can feel the flow of the void around you, and on occasion can even direct it to manifest in mystical ways.

## Flaws

### Pyromaniac

You love fire. You always have. Io has always been beautiful to you, and you are thankful to have grown up on a world that always burns. You always carry a lighter or matches, and you can't help but set fires wherever you go.

### Aberrant Mind

You see things others don't. Shapes floating in space. Figures darting between cargo crates just out of sight. The silhouettes of men on the edges of your peripheral vision. People say you're paranoid, but you know they're there. Something is following you, getting closer every time you sleep.

## Signature Move

### Storm-Touched

Your body moves freely with storms and the elements. During a Gales challenge, you may reroll any number of dice you choose once.

## Inventory

### Amplifying Fork

This simple tool is nothing more than a length of metal (usually less than half a meter long) with two prongs on one end. Most Arc-casters discovered that conductive metals can help amplify their abilities, and that a fork or bident shape allows them to focus their power into a single direction. Without such a instrument, it is very difficult for an Arc-caster to command their abilities as they wish. Many have no control at all without a fork. Powerful Arc-casters wield amplifying forks like they are magic wands, allowing them to hurl searing bolts of electricity with deadly precision. Copper, silver, and gold amplifying forks have proven to be the most effective.

### Reverse-Engineered Wanderer Sonic Cannon

The ear-splitting sound emitted from the Wanderer during the Incident was well recorded. So much so that the scientists have been able to replicate that sound, and even weaponize it. The Wanderer Sonic Cannon is an effective nonlethal firearm, capable of instantly incapacitation any human it is trained on. The technology is complex, however, and very few people know how to repair them.

## Notes

The Runner (The Immolated One) owns our butts and the ship we're on. Currently transporting pirate prisoners...somewhere. Discovered how the power grid is laid out on the ship. Found a lot of power is being funneled to the restricted Deck 3, labeled simply "Intel." It's not unusual for there to be a restricted deck, but Halfrek is suspicious.
