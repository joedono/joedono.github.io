I'm just chilling with my son, watching cartoons and blogging while my wife takes some time...somewhere, away from us, to chill out and rest. I'm certain she's on her phone reading about what's happening in the world or getting into some argument or other.

I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do with myself today. I had four pages left in my sketchbook, and I filled one of them with nothing but hatches. I think that's supposed to be a useful exercise, but I don't know if I was doing it right. Either way, now I have three pages left, all I can really think about is finishing them, but I don't actually want to draw anything. My wife suggested that I attempt to draw from a real still-life rather than a picture of one, and that's probably a good idea. The problem is trying to keep any sort of setup with planned lighting and carefully laid out objects in one arrangement for long enough to finish drawing a picture of it while there's a three-year-old raining destruction down on the general area is really hard, especialy when you're the one watching said avatar of destruction. Right now, I'm typing this with my eyes closed because said destroyer has thrown a blanket over my head. I'm actually kind of impressed that I'm managing to type reasonably well. I'll leave these past couple sentences unedited so you can see what my skill looks like. I just hope that I don't accidentially tap or click on the touchpad with the edge of my hand.

I've got a bit of a virtual gaming party planned for tomorrow. I hope that will take the edge off of this isolation I'm feeling. I really want to interact with people again. I've been reading too much of the news and it **all** sounds so depressing. They're all talking about how the southern and midwest states haven't taken this pandemic seriously and now their ICU beds are at capacity. Meanwhile, we worked so hard in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast that we feel comfortable opening back up again, despite the fact that we still have enough cases to spawn a second wave if we do and that people from other states are likely to ruin it for us completely. Meanwhile, our federal leadership continues to not... be that. There are no more briefings. There are no more recommendations. There are no more reports of numbers or current states of things. There is no plan... I've been thinking that it's less and less likely that my company will survive this. I honestly don't know whether a good chunk of companies will survive this. It's such a mess. I'm even starting to think about what we'll have to do if home-schooling our kid becomes necessary. Fortunately, he's just barely too young to start school this fall, so the world has a year and a half to put itself back together before we have to worry about that particular obstacle. Not that we won't have a bunch more important things to worry about before that. If social distancing lasts into autumn, I don't know how we'll take it, and we're on the patient side of things, as far as most of this country goes.

At least I still have my games. I picked up a few things from my wishlist during the Steam Summer Sale, including Doom Eternal. Murdering hordes of demons is very cathartic...when I actually have time to play, that is. I'm close to my goal of full 80 in FFXIV, then I plan on taking a break from that to focus more on other games.

My head was uncovered through most of that large paragraph, but now it's getting covered again....

I found a website called Drawabox, which advertises itself as an "art fundamentals course." There's a lengthy article in it justifying why you should go through the course using ink instead of pencil, paint, or some other medium. The crux of it is to remove the temptation to cheat by erasing or drawing lighter lines. I'm cheating pretty badly and using it as something to follow to get me used to using my tablet and drawing digitally. I'm only on lesson 1, and I'm not sure if I've improved all that much yet. I feel like what I really need is for someone to take me through their digital art process. I've watched a couple speedpaints, and the going method seems to be:

1. Sketch the basic shapes on one layer
2. Dim that layer and create a new layer
3. Sketch a more detail-oriented picture on the new layer
4. Dim that layer
5. Ink the hard lines onto the new layer
6. Add another new layer and fill in the flat colors for things
7. Add another new layer for the shadows
8. Add another new layer for the highlights

Wow...I didn't think I'd actually be able to write that out. Maybe I do know enough to try this out. I think I'm going to do that after I fill up my sketchbook. No, that's a stupid arbitrary limit to put on myself. I'm just going to do what I like. I'll fill up my sketchbook, work through Drawabox, and create my own digital art image, all at the same time.
