I'm having a really hard time getting the existing constriction engine to work like the image I have in my head. Difficulty is getting harder to define too. I honestly don't know how to take this all-screen-constriction and make it challenging at the start, but still get more difficult over time. Therefore, I'm switching back to my original *original* idea of just having the left and right walls constrict on the player.

I may rename the game to something like "Trash Compactor," but the feel and tension will be the same. Not to mention that collision detection and increasing difficulty will be a whole lot easier with this idea.

I'm still going to go with a particle idea to give the constricting walls more of a "foggy" look. I may hide the wall-rectangles entirely and see what kind of effect that gives. Here's a screenshot of what the new constriction looks like. Obviously, the color will be changed soon.

I may still try and implement an effect to give the constriction a more liquid look. That will probably involve looking up water physics engines, which is a little more complicated than I wanted this game to be. But considering that all I have left are the title and game over screens, the difficulty curve, and the particle system, I'm set up to have some time left before the month is over. I can look in to the water idea or spend some time "juicing" up the game.
