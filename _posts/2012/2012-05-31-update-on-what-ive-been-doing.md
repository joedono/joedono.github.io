Ooooo. Blogspot updated their tools. Spiffy.

Ahem. So I'm about to start a new project with some friends. We're going to give "team development" a shot. This means my next project will actually have some art in it. Plus, I'll have other people around to keep me motivated. Currently, we're learning where everyone's skills lie and figuring out which roles in game dev suit them best. We're probably going to go with a third-party game building software, which somewhat diminishes how much I can contribute, since programming is my strong suit. The only other thing I know about the project is that it'll be a classical fantasy rpg. Actually, even the "fantasy" part could be changed. We don't even have a game idea yet.

In the meantime, I've been reading through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/XNA-4-0-Game-Development-Example/dp/1849690669/">XNA 4.0 Beginner's Guide</a>. It's a decent programming book. It uses 4 game projects of increasing complexity to teach you game programming in C#/XNA by example. The projects are laid out pretty nicely in a way that allows for adding of new features as the book teaches you different things about the XNA library. It doesn't spend very much time on the basics of C#, so it's not really for people who are completely new to programming. I'm currently about 3/4 through the 3rd example project and I've definitely learned quite a bit. I never thought that Vector Math would come in handy, or that I had actually been using it in all my previous games.

Also, something everyone should check out: <a href="http://zanrai.com/heavenvariant/">Heaven Variant</a>. This is a side-scrolling shooter currently in development by indie studio Zanrai Interactive. They're using the Unreal Development Kit for it and it looks AWESOME!!
