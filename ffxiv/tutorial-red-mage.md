This guide was written for patch 5.3

Red Mage is a caster DPS class. This means a couple things:
1. You are ranged and usually stay away from enemies
2. You do the most damage when you don't have to move
3. You have to pay attention to your MP and manage it accordingly

For Role Actions:
1. Required - `Lucid Dreaming`
2. Highly Recommended - `Swiftcast`
3. Optional - `Surecast`, `Addle`

Red Mage revolves around three concepts:
1. `Duelcast` and spell procs
2. Managing the White/Black Balance Gauge
3. Your melee combo

## Duelcast
You get the `Duelcast` buff whenever you cast a spell with a cast time (which is all of them) when you don't already have the buff. When you have the buff, your next spell with a cast time has no cast time. This basically means that every other spell you cast has no casting time. This has a couple effects:
1. You are able to move around more than other caster DPS classes as you cast spells with the Duelcast buff
2. You are able to actually do your rotation, which includes spells with looooong cast times.

## Procs
This is where the bulk of your focus will be when playing Red Mage. Your rotation is full of random forks and divergences (which makes it difficult to express in text, but here we go). You have two kinds of spells: long cast and short cast. Your rotation will be Cast Short Spell -> Gain `Duelcast` Buff -> Cast Long Spell. Which actual spells you cast will depend on your procs and where you are on the Balance Gauge.

### Short Cast Spells
1. `Jolt`
2. `Verthunder`
3. `Veraero`

### Long Cast Spells
1. `Verfire`
2. `Verstone`

You'll never want to cast `Verfire` or `Verstone` without having the `Duelcast` buff.

If you have nothing, cast `Jolt` to get the `Duelcast`.  
If you have the `Verthunder Ready` buff, cast `Verthunder` to get the `Duelcast`.  
If you have the `Veraero Ready` buff, cast `Veraero` to get `Duelcast`.

Fortunately, the `Verthunder` and `Veraero` procs also light up the skill icons, so you don't have to watch your buff bar.

## Balance Gauge
Along with the `Duelcast`, managing the balance gauge will be how you decide what spells to cast. Your goals are to keep the white and black energy gauges close together, and to get them both up to 80. If the gauges get too far apart, then the jewel at the top of the gauge will turn the color of the higher gauge, and it will be harder to raise the opposite gauge.

`Jolt` raises both gauges a small amount. `Veraero` and `Verstone` raise the white gauge. `Verthunder` and `Verfire` raise the black gauge.

So, as said before, your rotation is full of "if"s.

If you don't have `Duelcast` or procs, cast `Jolt`.  
If you have a proc, cast the appropriate `Verfire` or `Verstone` spell.  
If you have `Duelcast` and your Black Gauge is lower, cast `Verfire`.  
If you have `Duelcast` and your White Gauge is lower, cast `Verstone`.

## Melee Combo
While you could technically go through your melee abilities whenever, the combo is considerably more powerful when both your White and Black gauges are 80 or higher. As a ranged dps, it's understandable that you might have some trouble getting into melee range, so you have a gap closer ability and a jump back ability. So, your melee combo is:

1. `Corps-a-corps` - To close the gap. Not necessary if you're already in melee range, but don't waste your time walking.
2. `Enhanced Riposte`
3. `Enhanced Zwerchhau`
4. `Enhanced Redoublement`
5. `Displacement` - To jumpback and get out of melee range. Be careful not to jump back off an edge or into an AOE or something...

### Melee Combo Followups
The above lessons will carry you through any content up to level 60. For levels 70+, you gain a couple followups for your melee combos.

Executing `Enhanced Redoublement` will unlock `Verflare` and `Verholy` as combo actions. Executing either of these will automatically grant the appropriate proc for the same gauge: `Verflare` unlockes `Verfire Ready`, and `Verholy` unlocks `Verstone Ready`.

If you're level 80, `Verflare`/`Verholy` will also unlock Scorch, your hardest hitting single spell. Obviously, you'll want to cast it immediately. `Verflare`, `Verholy`, and `Scorch` have no cast times, so that's a good time to move around and dodge things.

## Other Skills
Everything above covers your main rotation. Of course, you have a handful of other skills that range in usefulness.

### Off-Cooldown Skills
`Fleche` is your free, off-cooldown, single-target skill. Use it whenever it's up for free damage between your other skills.

`Contre Sixte` is your free, off-cooldown, AOE skill. Also use it whenever it's up for free damage between your other skills.

### AOE Skills
`Verthunder II`, `Veraero II`, and `Scatter` are your AOE skills. `Verthunder II` and `Veraero II` are short cast skills that grant `Duelcast`, and `Scatter` is a long cast skill. So your rotation will be `Verthunder II` or `Veraero II`, depending on which side of the Balance gauge is lower, then `Scatter`, then repeat.

### Buffs
`Acceleration` is a really handy skill that guarantees that the next three skills that have a chance to proc will absolutely proc. The buff has a time limit, so it's most effective to use when your gauges are low and you don't interrupt the magical part of your rotation to do the melee part.

`Embolden` is a good damage-up buff. It increases your own magical damage and any nearby party members physical damage for a time. This means it's less useful when you have more magical DPS in your party and few physical DPS. It also doesn't affect your melee attacks. So use it when your gauges are low and when you have a physical dps or a tank friend nearby.

`Manafication` is your best buff. It doubles the value of your Balance gauges, resets the timer on Corps-a-corps, and increases your magic damage dealt. You want to use this when both your Balance gauges are 40 or higher and you know you'll be able to pull off your full melee combo with followups, without being interrupted. The timer lasts just long enough for your three-hit melee combo, `Verflare`/`Verholy`, and `Scorch`.

### Misc Skills
These skills don't fit into any of the other categories and some have limited usefulness. Some are included for completeness, but others can save a raid.

`Verraise` is probably what other players know the Red Mage best for, and one of the handy features Red Mage shares with Summoner. The advantage Red Mage has is that `Verraise` can be affected by `Duelcast`. That means, as long as the Red Mage has a way to get the `Duelcast` buff, `Verraise` can always be cast with no cast time. Hooray for perpetual Swiftcast!

`Vercure` has more limited usefulness. It's a short cast spell that both grants and is affected by `Duelcast`, which means you can cast it twice very quickly. Unfortunately, it takes two casting to equal the average healing amount put out by a White Mage's basic Cure spell. So, it's useful in a pinch, but your time is better spent doing damage.

`(Enhanced) Moulinet` is your melee AOE ability. My usual AOE rotation is to raise both gauges to 100, cast `Enhanced Moulinet` twice (which will lower your gauge to 60), use `Manafication` (doubles the gauges, raising them back to 100), then cast `Enhanced Moulinet` 5 more times.

`Engagement` is an off-cooldown attack with no real special properties. It shares its cooldown timer with `Displacement`, which is your jumpback ability from your melee combo. You would use `Engagement` when you're at the part of your melee combo where you'd use `Displacement`, but jumping back will put you off the stage or into an enemy AOE.

`(Enhanced) Reprise` is like the Black Mage's `Scathe`. It's a ranged, weak attack with no cast timer. You use it when you have to run and still want to keep up damage. It's only worth casting when you have enough in your Balance Gauges to upgrade it to the Enhanced version.

## Summary
Your goal as a Red Mage for maximum damage is to use `Duelcast` and your proc abilities to raise your Black and White Balance Gauges to 80, then close the gap to your enemy and go through your melee combo and followups, and repeat.
