title: "Level Design...Ugh"

I have now come to the point that always seems to stop me cold in my projects. Level Design. I'm almost half-way through this stage with Unbalanced Equation and my productivity has gone down the tubes. I'm incredibly proud of Wizard Plumber so far, but there aren't any actual puzzles in the game just yet.

I've got a rudimentary title screen, level select screen, and winner's screen, but the next step is to actually design some content. I can never seem to get up the motivation to actually do this part.
