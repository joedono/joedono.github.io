I'm putting Candlehead on the shelf for now. Developing it just isn't fun anymore. The whole thing was kind of forced to being with. Not to mention life getting in the way.

So what can I learn from this experience? First off, it reinforces the idea that, when developing a game, you want to get something that is at least playable VERY quickly. That way, you can immediately see how changes you make and features you add will affect the entire game. Secondly, some ideas just don't make for fun games. Even the tech demos I came up with weren't very fun. The mechanic was more frustrating than actually enjoyable.

So Candlehead is going on the back burner for now. We'll see what my next project ends up being. My research says that <a href="http://www.dreambuildplay.com/Main/Default.aspx">Dream.Build.Play</a> is coming up. Maybe I'll see about competing.
