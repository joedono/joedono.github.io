I'm heading to Philly tomorrow for PAX Unplugged, my second dedicated tabletop convention experience (I don't count PAX East).

I'm pretty excited, even though I'm only found two things I want to do on the website: do the Helios Conspiracy escape room and visit the Monocle Society booth. Most of the other events require registration at the convention or are just first-come-first-serve, just like PAX East. I should probably download the app... that's better.

I finally heard back from Monocle regarding whether they were planning on announcing me at the convention. The answer was unfortunately no. But that's the smart answer. We don't have anything down on paper and they haven't even looked at my playset yet. It would be silly if they announced the set only to have me back out or something. So I'll go to the booth, show my face, maybe see if I can get some pickup games going, and just enjoy myself. I'll at least enjoy having a vacation for a couple days.
