title: "Double Jump...or Run"

I originally wanted the third upgrade to your arsenal in Unbalanced Equation to be a double jump. But, seeing as how the character can jump 5x their height anyway, it seems like being able to move at twice your (slow) speed would be more appreciated and I would be better able to come up with original ways to utilize it.
