This marks the first time that I've designed an AI complicated enough that I had to draw a state diagram before coding it. I've got the movement code for the Timid Walking Monstrosities coded in. I was originally going to have them start in hiding holes that were part of the platforming, but that would allow the player access to them and the opportunity to chase them out of it. I didn't want to code behavior that complex, so I'm going to have hiding holes in the background of the level that the monsters can retreat into. That way, the player can walk right past them and I don't have to code them trying to run away to an unknown target.
