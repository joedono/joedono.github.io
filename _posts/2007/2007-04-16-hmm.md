Well, today felt a little unfulfilling. This morning was a nice easy Japanese test (a little too easy, maybe I'm in the wrong class for that too). One of my afternoon classes was cancelled, so I had about 5 hours with not much to do other than explore somewhere else. The teacher of my second, and last, class of the day gave us a stern talking to when we didn't do the homework that he posted on the website that he didn't tell us about. Then I had to rush to our first ballroom meeting. I found out that instead of teaching us moves we can use anywhere at anytime, they were planning on teaching us a choreographed dance that we could only do with other people in the club.

There was an upside, though. The regular members were so excited when they found out I and two of the foreign girls new swing that they had us do a short demo for them. That was pretty cool. However, I'm thinking about switching to the hip-hop club. Hopefully, I won't miss too much making these kind of decisions. I still haven't found time to check out the judo club yet.

No developments on switching the religion course yet.

The more people I tell, the better it gets. I now have about 8 other foreign students that want me to take them to Yuta's fire show in May. Now that's something to look forward to.

Gotta go. I have a Kanji quiz tom morning
