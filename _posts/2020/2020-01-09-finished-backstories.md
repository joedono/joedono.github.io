I'm surprised I made such substantial progress on my playset tonight. It took me...2 days!!?? Wow, that really is surprising. I even came up with a new concept to help with a couple Backstories, Items, and Themes. Turns out the really big Fantasy Name Generator site generates names for all kinds of things, including fictional sports.

Enter *CryoTag*, the predominant sport of Sia Malak. Players are divided into Predators and Prey, depending on their talents. Through some mixture of magic and technology, the Prey are set up so that when they are touched by a Predator, they are frozen in place and can't move. Predators must then take the frozen Prey back to their Den, where they cannot be touched by other Predators. Every game has two winners: the last Prey standing and the Predator with the most points. There's a lot of sabotage, with Prey leaving other Prey for Predators, and Predators attacking other Predators to steal frozen Prey before they make it back to their Den. The arena is probably located on an island in Darkmire, where the maximum number of participants can enter without worrying about environmental weaknesses. The topography of the arena is randomized every match, without taking anything about the participants into account. This sometimes leads to some quick matches for some as the environment plays against specific monster weaknesses, but it also encourages some really creative solutions. That one year that a vampire won as a Predator when the arena was a sun-scorched desert was quite a year.

Next up will be Items and Signature Moves. Those will be fun.
