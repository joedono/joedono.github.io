This is probably going to come off as an extremely self-centered and arrogant post. I try very hard to walk the line between confidence and arrogance, but it's **really** hard.

I was driving home the other day and thinking about my career so far. I had a conversation with my mother about work-life balance and how I felt that work should end when you're off the clock. She brought up that my father, a very successful medicinal chemist, brought a LOT of work home with him and was always reading papers and scientific magazines and doing research and stuff. It's not like he was an absent father by any means, but I was a little shocked at how much work he put in after work was over for the day. Then I thought about my own career. I've never felt like I brought work home with me. I never worked on a work project outside of working hours. I don't answer calls, emails, or chat messages outside of working hours unless it's planned, like an overnight release or something. I always felt I had a good work-life balance. I still do, even after thinking this through. But I also realized that's not what my mother meant.

She was referring to supplementary training and research. My father might have thought a little about the reactions he was doing at work or the next presentation he was going to do, but he didn't spend much time actually working on those things outside the office. He was reading papers published by other chemists and learning about new breakthroughs and advancements in the industry. I've been doing the same thing. I learned whole new programming languages outside of work. I have a decent number of side projects, most of which are games, I admit. I've done research into open-source development. I'm the volunteer webmaster for two other organizations, one of which actually requires a LOT of work from me. I'm constantly learning and evolving and doing what I can to keep up with the industry. I just started listening to some software engineering podcasts and now I'm learning new concepts that may or may not come in handy in the future. My head has become a massive database of things I've learned and can apply both to work projects and personal projects. I'm good at what I do.

I'm a professional.

I felt a very profound sense of self-satisfaction when that thought occurred to me on my commute home. I don't think I suffer from severe imposter syndrome, but it creeps in every now and again. This was the first time I didn't feel that at all.

Some of this was probably due to my recent glowing performance review. I've now had two managers tell me that, if they had 100 more employees like me, they would never have any problems running the team/business ever again. It might have also been that I wasn't surprised when my manager told me that, which in and of itself, was somehow **more** surprising to me. It's like my confidence had finally caught up with my ability.

I know what I'm doing. My work is worth being paid for. I'm deep enough in the industry that I'm hard to replace. I feel like I've arrived finally.

I know this doesn't mean I can get complacent. I spent the next 30 minutes thinking about whether there are any other careers where the knowledge and techniques people in those careers apply to their work evolves and transforms as fast as it does in software development. I've arrived, but I can still be left behind if I don't keep researching things on my own.
