So today was the volleyball game I mentioned in my previous email. It turns out that many other dorms were represented there too. We were scattered into teams made up of people from other dorms and put into a tournament bracket. Being one of the three teams that had a relatively tall foreigner, we made it all the way to the finals. There, we met a team with another lone foreigner from Holland, who was a good 7 inches taller than me. Since the net was lower than usual to begin with, he didn't even have to jump to block or spike the ball. We lost the finals, but put up a good fight. Afterward, we all went to a buffet lunch. The food was really good: chicken, fruits including oranges, pineapples, and kiwis, and an assortment of small cakes. One other person on my team was a foreigner, she's from the Philippines. She and another girl on my team spoke good English, but I still managed more practice than I have in weeks. The last thing we did was an obstacle course relay race. We kinda lost that one horribly, but it was still fun. I even managed to exchange a few words with the less social people from my own dorm as well. I have a few pictures, but I'll upload them later.
