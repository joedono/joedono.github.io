Whew, this is probably going to be a long post, since I'm starting this blog a month into development.

I've got the design of the Forest and Cave areas finished. They both have platforms, items, and barriers to facilitate MetroidVania style level progression. I have a basic tileset implemented in the Forest. It's just the platforms for now, but I'll add embellishment later.

It looks a bit like grassland. I should probably mention that I'm not an artist at all and that I'm working this project by myself. I don't expect it to become huge, but I do expect it to be finished at some point. For comparison, this is what one of the Cave rooms looks like currently without textures and all the debugging turned on:

So at least the Forest doesn't look terrible anymore. Both areas have items, health pickups, enemies, and at least function transitions between rooms (the red boxes in the Cave screenshot).
