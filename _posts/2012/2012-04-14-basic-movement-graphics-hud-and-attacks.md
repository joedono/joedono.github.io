After three days of development, I have something that looks kind of like a game. There's a player character who moves when the player tells him to, there are a few basic layouts for rooms so they're not completely empty, there is a basic floor and wall tileset so the player doesn't have to look at red blocks against a black background all the time, there's a simple sword attack, and there's even a minimap so the player doesn't get lost.
