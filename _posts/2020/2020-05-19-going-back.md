I can't take it anymore...

I'm starting to get requests for the AB website again, now that elections are over, and I have to admit, Atom's capabilities when editing PHP files that contain HTML are **far** superior to VS Code's. It just requires so much less from me. Atom is smart enough to know that php files can contain html, so it includes syntax highlighting, tag matching, auto-indent, and tag auto-closing right there in the default handling of the file. I suppose I could try to install some php extensions for VS Code, but the most popular one I found requires that I actually install php itself on my system. I should probably have that anyway, but only if I want to actually run the site. I've gotten by so far without actually doing that, and I'm not about to start now. I just want to write my code.

That said, I will admit that VS Code's capabilities when writing Angular applications is far better than Atom's. So I'm going to stick with having both on my machine. I'll use whatever the heck I want to make posts to this blog (writing in VS Code right now), since they both have decent Markdown support (not that there's much to support). I'll never find the perfect editor without spending all the time customizing it....
