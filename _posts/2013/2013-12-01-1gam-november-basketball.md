Here we are again. Just one more to go. This month's concept is fairly simple. Just Basketball. Not even full basketball. Just arcade freethrows. Built with GameMaker Studio no less. I must be nearing the home stretch. This is starting to get tedious. I'm starting to get some more project offers from friends of mine and I have to put them off because I'm devoting time to this. They're being really patient with me, but I'm glad I only have one more month of this. The 1GAM webmaster talked about building a version 2.0 of the site and continuing the event next year. I'll keep track, but I'm probably not going to participate.
