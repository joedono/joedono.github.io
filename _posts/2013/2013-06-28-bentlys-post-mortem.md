Man, this has just been a terrible month. Mostly because Google has (yet again) decided to phase out a feature that I use. I can no longer host runnable project files on their site. Google Code has removed the Downloads tab from all new projects. I can sort of understand it. They're essentially giving people free reign to people to host any kind of file they want on their servers. It's a policy ripe for abuse. So, it looks like I might end up switching to GitHub and devoting a folder in my project to a compiled version so people can just download it and run it.

Another huge issue is that the LimeJS compiler doesn't work for me. I tried downgrading my version of Python to 2.7 and going through the source code of the compiler to fix it, but I just didn't have the patience for tools that don't work the way they're supposed to. I may end up getting flak for not posting a completely playable version of the game, but there's nothing I can do. I'm going to be busy from now until the deadline, so my deadline is effectively tonight.

I had to pull out the vast majority of the features I had planned. Bently's Chemistry Lab has been reduced to a small touch game designed to teach people the symbols on the Periodic Table. There's nothing to give the game juice except a few sound effects. I'm incredibly disappointed in my performance this month. I think I'm running out of steam.

It probably also has to do with trying to learn LimeJS on the fly too. The library leaves a lot to be desired. It's so completely different from anything I'm used to. I can safely say that I'm not going to be using this library again. Even using SDL would have been more developer-friendly than this.

So that's that. Another month out of the way. I'm really disappointed that I've now had 2 throwaway months this year. However, there was bound to be more than one. Another thing I'm disappointed in is that it looks like I'm going to be the first to have his game posted for June on the 1GAM website. Unless there's something wrong with the site and McFunkyPants is waiting until the end of the month to show the June entries. Whatever. I'm just glad this month is over and I can move on to something a little easier to work with. I started learning GIT at work, but I may still use Google Code for source hosting.
