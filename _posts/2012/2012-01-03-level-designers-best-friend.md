I gotta say, level design is sooooooo much easier when you have graph paper and a plain text representation of your levels like this:

    0000000000
    0000000000
    1111000000
    0000000000
    0000000111
    0000000000
    0000000000
    1111111111

To think I thought I was hot stuff when I wanted to store my level design as XML. It wouldn't be anywhere near readable enough. And graph paper makes this SO much easier.

To all you level designers that aren't working with a set of tools specifically designed for designing levels, GET GRAPH PAPER.

Or...you could just design your own level designing tools. Whatever is easiest.
