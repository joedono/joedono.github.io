I'm not sure if all projects come to this point near the end of their development. I've put out three versions of this project in two days. I'd hesitate to call this new version a "True Alpha", but only because there have already been 2 alpha versions before this.

Technically, I could call this game complete. All the features I set down in the design have been implemented, at least to my satisfaction. This is only the second game I've created that made it to this stage in development that had any substance. Sure, I've made arcade type games like Dodge 'Em. But those are EXTREMELY simple and didn't seem to give me the full experience of making a game.

My play-testers have suggested putting in a finale of some kind, like a boss fight. Something to give resolution to the story. I agree that the game ends pretty abruptly. I'll put some thought into some kind of finale. In the meantime, enjoy the latest build! There's a slight possibility that it will be the last.
