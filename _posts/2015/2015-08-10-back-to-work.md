I'm better enough that I made it back to work. We went out and bought a sling because my arm felt like it was getting worse. I'm not sure I could have gotten through the day without it. Just goes to show that even people in the industry don't really know everything. I'm not 100% yet, but I think I should be better in raiding tonight.

Anyway, I finally got the hang of the collectible scrips thing. I had a lot of leftover gil from before the expansion that I spent on a set of HQ crafted Gathering gear. Turns out that let me skip 2-3 steps in progression and go straight to the last step. In another week and a half, I'm going to have my awesome MIN main-hand. 3 weeks later, I'm going to have my awesome BTN main-hand too. And at some point during this whole thing, I'm going to unlock the folklore tomes for the new areas and be one of the first to make bank on the legendary gathering nodes. I'm already making bank on the things people need for airships and for the new crafters coming up through progression. People keep needing Darksteel Ore, Silkworm Cocoons, and Ferberite, and that's just fine with me.

I'm only one drop away from getting my main geared up to where I want it for Savage. I could spend the time trying to get the pants, but I plan on buying the Eso version after reset happens. We're probably going to try to take on Ravana EX tonight, which will mean that I've cleared every MSQ and Side-Quest currently available. That's not including quests for leveling alternate classes, of course. And Savage doesn't actually have any quests attached to it. It's just there for end-game raiding.

I realized that this is my sixth post. Which means my paginator should activate. We'll have to see how it works out. EDIT: Well what do you know? I didn't have to do anything beyond what I did already.
