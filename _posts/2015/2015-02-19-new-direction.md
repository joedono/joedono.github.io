I'm going to try taking this blog in a new direction. My motivation to develop my own games has sharply declined since Thanataria was put on indefinite hold. I've only sort of settled on building the occasional tech demo in Love2D and I'm not going to make any money building tech demos by myself.

So, I'm going to try my hand at actually writing on this blog. I have a lot of energy and time left over from my day job that's just sitting here. But what to write about? Well, what else is there to write about? Games!! I'll share my experiences on games I've played. My history is certainly long enough to get me at least a few dozen stories. Hopefully, you'll enjoy reading about them as much as I did playing them.
