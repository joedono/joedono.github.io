Not a whole lot happened today. I completely forgot to bring my camera with me when I left this morning, but there wasn't anything to take pictures of anyway.

We had course registration today. Mine went off without a hitch, so I spent most of the rest of the day helping out other foreign students. I made friends with quite a few people, but I completely forgot about the whole exchanging your cell numbers by infrared thing and didn't get any contact info. It also felt a bit awkward when I thought about it, asking for someone I just met's cell number right off the bat.

The actual registration is done similar to ScanTron test, where you mark a piece of paper with a special pencil (it can actually be any pencil), the sheet is then scanned, then your courses are entered. You'd think that with all the other cool technologies Japan has, they'd have course registration online. The other funny thing is that I find out the results of my class selection the day classes start. Actually, I find out about an hour after my Japanese class is supposed to begin. This Thursday will be an interesting day.

I spent the rest of the day at a welcoming party for exchange students, where we got yelled at for eating and drinking before the toast, which is a big no-no here. Oh well, I invoked Baka Gaijin License (Stupid Foreigner) along with the rest of the room and all was forgiven.

I pretty much have nothing to do tomorrow. One of the other gaijin gave me his JR railway pass. It was good for 5 days (not necessarily in a row) free transport anywhere the JR train lines will take you, which is pretty much all of Tokyo. It has one day left on it, so all bets are off. I'm probably just going to take care of one of the red stickers in my guide book, but suggestions are most welcome.
