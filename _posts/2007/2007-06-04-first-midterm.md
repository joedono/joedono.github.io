Well, one down, three and a half to go. Today was my Japanese history midterm, and my severe lack of history skills came out blazing. I studied a little everyday for the past five days, and I'm still not confident in my answers. I should know so much more than I do considering that the section on Japan is the part that I payed the most attention to in my regular history classes in the past. Of course, it didn't help that this teacher has never given us a test before, skips over parts of his lecture notes in class, and teaches through stream of consciousness. He even bell curves the grades so that some people are guaranteed to fail. What a way to start.

Oh well, I knew going in that this was going to be my most difficult class yet, given my history with...history classes in general. Anyway, my remaining finals are as follows:

1 Anthropology final (essay type) Thursday 1 Religion final (???? type) 2 weeks from today 1 Japanese final (standard test type) Thursday and Friday 1/2 Japanese oral presentation (skit type) Wednesday

The Anthropology and Japanese final will be fine, and the religion final is just a question mark. It could go either way. But, no matter what, I'm going to have to have some big celebration planned after this is all over. Most people have given up their social lives for this week, so I know they'll be itching to go out somewhere. Wish me luck (I need more of it).
