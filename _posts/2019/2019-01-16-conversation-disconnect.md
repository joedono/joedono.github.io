title: Conversation Disconnect
category: rant

I've been noticing an upsetting trend in my conversations with my wife. I will usually try to start a conversation with "How was X activity that you mentioned you'd be doing today?" and I'll be met with something completely unrelated. The other day, I asked her how much she managed to get done on her sewing project. She answered by saying "Well, I just got out of the shower." Just now, I asked her how her session at the ice skating rink was, and she said "At the grocery store." With that second one, I'm about 75% sure that the implication was "I'm at the grocery store, so I'm a little busy. I'll respond later when I'm home." But her response was so disconnected from the subject of the conversation, I can't help but think that she just doesn't want to talk about it and doesn't feel comfortable telling me why. Whenever she does this, I get the impression that she doesn't want to talk to me about whatever X activity I'm asking about. I start trying to imagine what reason she could possibly have for not talking to me, and for not wanting to come out and admit that she doesn't want to talk to me. It's extremely upsetting.

I've told her about this, but I don't think she realizes when she does it. I want to call her out on it more, but like I said above, this latest example has the implication that she doesn't want to talk because she's busy, so I'll just be annoying her by asking for clarification. I asked anyway, since on some level, I realize that I'm overthinking it and should just ask rather than ruminating over it and trying to imagine what she's thinking.

She got back to me, confirmed that she was just busy, and we're having a nice conversation now. Stupid rumination...
