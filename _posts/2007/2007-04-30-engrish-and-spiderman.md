Again, not much happened today. We went to the Engrish store. They didn't allow cameras, and all the T-shirts were $50. So, needless to say, i don't have any evidence that I was actually there, just the memory.

We went to the movie theater and picked up the reserve tickets for the movie tomorrow. We get to see it before all of you, nyah nyah nyah. At least, I think we do. Really looking forward to it.

So, yeah...finally got off my butt and did a bit of research on my Kyoto trip. I don't think it's going to happen. There is a bullet train that can get me there in 2 hours, but this is prime travel time for all Japan, so it'll be REALLY crowded. I was thinking of just taking the train to a couple random stations that are nowhere on my radar and seeing what's there. Also, since the people who expressed interest in going saw the price ($200 for a one-way ticket) they dropped out on me. Plus, if I wait until after May 4th, there is a Japanese girl who studied at Fairfield last semester who will be returning then. She'll probably let me stay at her house for a weekend and be happy to show me around. So I'll make it a weekend trip at a later date.

As far as I can tell, no one else has made any big plans for this weekend. Most of them are coming to the fire show on Saturday. I had the most developed plans and they fell through, so we're kinda at a loss except for the guide books (which I still have yet to open). There's always more homework too.
