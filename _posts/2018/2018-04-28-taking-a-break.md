I’ve been inadvertently taking time off from Bump in the Night to work on the convention website. Now that the convention itself is over, I’m getting all sorts of requests for the website for next year. Requests that will be forgotten until a few months before next year’s convention.

Which reminds me, I have to prepare for the elections today.

I’ve hit a roadblock with Bump in the Night anyway. I made that big post a while ago about the ray gun mechanics and it looked like I had decided on things, but I’m still not happy with the idea. I’ll probably just have to build it as I decided and see how it works. Maybe I’ll get an idea in the middle of testing or something.

I’ve been really wanting to work with either Electron or Vue. I suppose I can technically work with both, I just don’t have any ideas for something to build. Maybe I can make something better for the convention. I do have a handful of tools built in a hodgepodge of things. Most of them are script generators of one form or another. I need to come up with an idea that has a rich UI. I just don’t know. All the desktop apps I use are either glorified text editors, games, or internet browsers. I don’t know what normal people use computers for other than looking stuff up online. Isn’t that weird?

I suppose I should stick with my current projects. I have the con website, which has a giant feature request. I have the Easter egg game I still haven’t started yet. And I have Bump in the Night. Not to mention my normal work project.
