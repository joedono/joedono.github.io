Wow... at this point, even I can tell that I've gotten better at sketching. I've been doing it regularly since September, sooo... about a month and a half. I suppose that's not a whole lot of time. Looking back, maybe I haven't actually improved that much. I'm just gaining confidence. My Mickey Mouse and Sleeping Dragon were really good, my Ponyo was kind of crappy, my Bulbasaur and Pikachu were good, my Hilda and Jigglypuff were terrible, my Mickey Mouse and Mandragora were good, my Larvitar was terrible, my Superman is good, my Green Lantern is terrible. It's almost like I'm inconsistent! Imagine that!!

I'm still sticking to drawing cartoon characters with references. Those have been mostly really good, but all of my "real life" drawings were crap.

I really confused my kid when I picked out my latest subject. he really likes the "Ballad of Nessie" picture book, telling the story of the Loch Ness Monster, who "was rumored a monster, which wasn't quite right. For she was really a softie, with no bark and no bite." After reading that to him the other night, I flipped back and snapped a picture I could use for reference later. He gave me a look that said, "Why are you going back? We're all done with that story." What followed was what I consider my most accurate freehand sketch to date.

I seriously can't believe that image came from my hand. It looks like it came out of the pre-inked portfolio of the book itself. I kind of want to take that and run with it, just re-illustrate the whole rest of the book. I've been eyeing "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" for a while now too. I wonder if my kid's books will be my next source of models and reference photos. They're all at a good level of complexity, especially the Toy Story books. The problem will be getting the books out of his bedroom while I work on them. I'm getting kind of tired of drawing from my phone. It's just so damned convenient.
