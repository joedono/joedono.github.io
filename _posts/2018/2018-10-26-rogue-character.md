It's that time again!

I've actually been invited to play in another D&D campaign with a bunch of people. And with no provocation from me! They just invited me! Out of the blue!! That happens to me so rarely that I feel like crying.

So here we are again. Here's another brainstorming stream-of-consciousness dump of me creating a character. I'm told that the party already has 2 warlocks, 1 fighter, and 1 bard. Being just a *little* obsessed with party balance, I can fill the gaps with a rogue, a cleric, a barbarian, a paladin, or a monk. Basically, a healer, a physical utility character, or a melee combatant. I think I'm going to walk through creating a rogue and see how it goes.

So a rogue has three archetypes, thief, assassin, and arcane trickster. I sort of know how the assassin archetype works from Critical Role, and it also sounds the most useful in terms of combat. So let's go with that. I'm an assassin. What's a few sentences that could describe my backstory? Or at least the sort of person I am. I'm starting to lean towards tiefling for race. So a tiefling assassin. I want to be a deep red, like my old chocobo companion from FFXIV. What's my name going to be? What haven't I used from Dark Souls? Or is there something else I can use? Ooooo, Nosk from Hollow Knight could work. What else? Dettlaff from The Witcher? Seems too prominent. Nah, let's go with Nosk the tiefling rogue assassin.

Off to D&D Beyond!

Alright, Nosk has been mathed out. Now I just need to come up with a few sentences to describe some of his backstory and personality. What sort of a person is Nosk? The creature from Hollow Knight...might give me some help. It's a lure bug that impersonates another person in order to lure prey into its lair, then it spits acid at them before consuming them. So I could be a false-facer, excelling at disguise and subterfuge. Maybe that makes me a compulsive liar. Maybe I'll also make him enochlophobic (afraid of crowds), which I just learned is different from agoraphobic (fear of being humiliated in front of people). What does Nosk want? Maybe a confidant? Someone who see through his lies and still be his friend, his companion in the darkness. He's afraid of crowds because...he doesn't like being watched. It's not that he doesn't like interacting with people. Maybe he had a demon stalking him for most of his life and he recently managed to get rid of it by enlisting the help of some clerics of Leira, the goddess of illusion, who gave Nosk a new face? No, that's too elaborate. They tricked the demon into thinking that Nosk had been killed or something. So Nosk hates feeling like he's being watched.

And we're done. That's Nosk. The tiefling rogue assassin who doesn't like being watched or crowds, who was stalked by an unseen demon when he was younger, but managed to shake it with the help of the clerics of Leira and their illusion magic. Now, he lives in the shadows and makes a living in murder.
