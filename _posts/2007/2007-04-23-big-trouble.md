title: Big Trouble Brings New Resolve

So I just had one of the biggest scares of my life just now. My computer died. Something happened to the boot registry and I couldn't boot up Windows. I have all the operating system disks with me, but that would mean reformating my hard drive and losing everything. Fortunately, that didn't happen. My computer's autorecover function restored it to mostly functional, but there seem to be a few lagging problems. So, I've resolved to reformat the hard drive anyway, but not before going to Akihabara and investing in a rather large external hard drive to backup my files on. It might be a bit of a long process, but there should be no pitfalls. It might not be necessary now, but it'll save me a lot of trouble when this computer finally does kick the bucket.

Need sleep for test tomorrow.
