I haven't had a whole lot of time to work on Candlehead for the past couple days. I started up on a few website projects for some friends. One of them will hopefully draw in some business for some of my other hobbies.

Meanwhile, I've simplified my enemy classes so that the two Timid Monstrosity types inherit from a base class. They behave in pretty much the same way, only one can move vertically, while the other can't. It's not that big of a change.

I've also added a brightness control to the Options screen. I haven't done much experimenting with it on different computers, but most of the burden of finding the right brightness will be on the player.
