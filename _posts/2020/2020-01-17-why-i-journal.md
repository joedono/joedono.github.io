title: Why I Journal
category: general

I got bit by the philosophical bug today. I went and checked out my Feedly feed, which of course had over 1K unread entries in it. That's what I get for subscribing to BBC News and never reading it. One of the sites I subscribe to is the Art of Manliness. All stereotypes of misogyny aside, it's actually a really good site. It promotes a very rigid definition of being a man, but at least that definition also defines a good person. Someone who values family, service, justice, and kindness.

Anyway, one of the articles I chanced upon related to keeping a journal. While it didn't start that way, that's completely what this blog has turned in to. I'm reasonably careful what I put on here, but I do have an entire post category called "Rant" where I'll complain about work and occasionally about some problem or another in my life. I have a different private place where I keep my really dark musings.

But the article got me thinking about why I keep a journal. I suppose the main reason is so that I have something to do when I have absolutely nothing better to do. A large number of posts here were made because I was bored. I have a handful of posts that are me brainstorming something, usually D&D character backstories or names of things. But most are records of interesting things happening in my life. Most are related to gaming, as that's my most prominent hobby and takes up the most of my time, behind work and sleep that is. Some are about my foray into sketching. A few are about my son. Some of my old ones were about game or web development. The really old ones were records of my experiences with old games. Maybe I'll write a memoir some day.

I do reap the benefits of writing down my thoughts when I'm processing some dark emotion or struggling with a difficult decision. That has helped me a bunch over the past few years.
