That's certainly the word I'd use to describe today.

I had a terrible dream last night that included me getting as angry as I'd ever gotten in my life. I'm talking seeing red and completely furious. Seems my brain decided that being that angry in a "normal" situation wasn't "me" enough, so the dream got weird and started including an alien invasion and the plot of Doom. Thanks brain for letting me wake up extremely angry and depressed.

I made a bit of a breakthrough with Sia Malak yesterday. I was struggling with how to come up with enemies without being too restrictive. I didn't really want to put in the effort to come up with 44 unique combinations of classical monsters when that would obviously leave some out. So I'm going to transfer nearly all the classical monsters from Iron & Salt over to Sia Malak, but leave an instruction to the storyteller to always scan **two** cards when adding enemies and hybridize them together to make a unique monster. I'll leave it to them to figure out how something that's half ghost and half zombie came to be. Should generate a lot of fun combinations, and I multiplied the number of possible monsters my set can generate. Next up is Bosses, which should be a little less daunting even though I'm actually going to be coming up with species and backstories for these creatures. There only needs to be 22 of them instead of 44. After that, I'll be transferring everything over to the cards and adding basic summaries, then I'll be ready to playtest!

I've decided that I'm going to take an hour every morning to work on myself and do something semi-productive. I'm at the point where video games are feeling like a waste of time again. Well...the one video game I play every day is starting to feel like a waste of time. That'll probably change when a patch comes out, and it's not like I'm giving it up entirely. I'll just be taking better advantage of all the time I get when I wake up early. I'll let the dogs out around 5:30am (like I have a choice), then I'll do what I like until 7:30am, then I'll do something productive or meditative for an hour, then I'll spend 8:30 to 9:00 getting ready to face the day, probably doing yoga with a friend online if I can help it.

Last night and this morning, I took a bit of a leap with my sketching. I decided to finally stop drawing things only from reference and try actually coming up with an original character. Getting the inspiration was pretty easy, I'd make my son into a cartoon and see how that would evolve. He's got the drawing equivalent of a t-pose at the moment, but I'm hoping to make many more designs of him in the near future, maybe even come up with a comic storyline for him, I dunno.

I'm waiting for my beginner piano book to come in. That's what I really wanted to do this morning, since we got a package from somewhere, but it turned out to be something else.

I just don't know what to do with myself today. I reached the end of my todo list at work again. I kinda want to start an Angular project that does something with a Coronavirus API.  Let's see what's out there...

[That was pretty easy](https://covid19api.com/). I think I'll try to come up with something easy so I can see line graphs of the world and various countries, see what the lines look like whenever I like. I suppose after that, it comes down to the validity of the data, which I can't know from here, but whatever. It'll just be a site for me anyway. On the other hand, it's not like I need a new project to work on right now. This is just sort of topical and might be a fun way to keep track of things without constantly going to the news. I'm pretty sure there's a ton of people doing this just for the heck of it nowadays, so we'll add my name to the pile too. Now it's just a matter of motivation, which has been in really short supply today.

I have a bunch of things I could be doing, but I can't seem to make myself do any of them. I'm zoning out a lot. I even zoned out in the middle of a dungeon this morning. Still managed to finish it with some of the best dodging and uptime I've ever had, but when it was done, I didn't actually remember doing it.

Right now, all I want to do is end the work day and go give my wife a break from watching our over-tired son, but I have to stay here another hour at least.

Or do I? I was just complaining that I reached the end of my todo list for today, and I'll have my phone on me so I can receive any messages people might send me. All my code reviews for right now are closed. Why not call it a day early and go out to spend time with the family?
