Way back in 2008, I was still in college. I had a free night among many and was surfing the night away on YouTube and CollegeHumor when I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video/3722352/chill-game">this video</a>. I was immediately intrigued by this and proceeded to do some more research. The tech demo was for a game called Unfinished Swan which was being developed by a studio that would later be known as <a href="http://giantsparrow.com/">Giant Sparrow</a>.

I went nuts over this video. I showed it to everyone I knew and added the studio's blog to my RSS feed so I could keep track of them. Around the end of 2010, I started to lose hope. The blog has been quiet for almost 2 years. Their last post detailed a "company lunch" and the one before that was about the new couch they got for their studio. Around this point, I was ready to label this game as vaporware and forget about it. But when I re-read the post about the company lunch, at the end was hidden a nugget of hope: they were having a live demo at PAX of the next year. Development was still on!

Then, it finally happened. Unfinished Swan produced a new trailer and a release date. I could not wait for October of 2012.

You will notice that October has mostly passed at this point. I own a copy of the game and have played it through once. So was it worth the wait? Hellz yeah it was! Over the past 4 years, I tried to imagine what I would use a mechanic like this for. Heck, I even gave it a shot myself (see The Great Inkscape under Projects to the right). Nearly everything I had imagined was implemented, and then some. The pacing was a little stunted and the story-telling method has you hunting around the game environment for story-book pages, all of which are entirely miss-able. The devs did a good job of making them obvious, but I'm pretty sure I missed a couple. Other than that, the central mechanic is used magnificently and evolves over the course of the game without really changing too much.

So go out and pick up Unfinished Swan, available now for purchase on Playstation Network.
