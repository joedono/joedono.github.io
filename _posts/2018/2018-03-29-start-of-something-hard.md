title: Start of Something Hard

Man, I really should have sprung for the 64GB laptop. This 32GB is painfully slow. Not to mention that I haven't turned it on since last summer, so it's constantly using processing cycles for updates.

Anyway, I'm starting what will probably be the hardest two days of my parenting career. My family is at the convention in Boston, which means my wife will be completely unavailable from now until Sunday morning. I'm going to be completely responsible for my son in a place he's only been to once, and that was before he could walk. My wife says it'll be just like surviving our trip to Utah, but the difference there is that I was able to put him down for a nap and leave the room without worrying about someone going into the room and waking him up. I was able to leave and keep the monitor with me in case he woke up and needed something. Now, I can't leave the room. And when he can see me, and I've left him in his travel crib, he won't sleep.

It's gotten better in the past couple hours. It's true that he wouldn't sleep in his travel crib, even when I hid. But he definitely wanted to sleep. I brought him over to the real bed and laid him down right in the middle of it. He slept like that for almost 3 hours, which is about the average length of one of his naps at home. Maybe there's hope for us both surviving this weekend yet.
