I've tried to be patient. I really have. I think I've mostly succeeded, but I think I'm about done.

I spent a good amount of time last year writing a playset for Weave based on Supernatural, Dresden Files, X-Files, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. People have been wondering whether they'd get a monster-of-the-week style playset, and I thought "That doesn't sound that hard, I'll give it a shot." I wound up with a fairly well put-together playset that I've demoed a few times and gotten really good feedback for. When I was nearing completion, the owner of Weave offered to import my playset so I could actually play it. I said no at the time because I didn't have cover art and the set needed some proofreading. That was last October. I finished the set in January and reached out to him in the beginning of February. I got some weird reply about how he had hired a new social media and marketing manager. I pressed for a real answer and he basically said, "if I have time." I understood. He's a busy guy running this company. Three months later, in May, I poked him again and got basically the same answer.

That wouldn't have been so bad. It was only mildly frustrating that it had now been 9 months since his initial offer and I hadn't seen any movement on it. But then, they post an announcement a couple weeks ago, congratulating another community member on their finished and imported playset. I was livid. Here I was, waiting for the owner to "have time" to import my playset, and he went and found time to spend importing someone else's. So frustrating.

I wouldn't be as upset if I hadn't already had these interactions with the owner, where he dangled this fruit in front of my eyes and refused to let me actually have it. I sent a message to this new "social media and marketing manager" since she actually replied to my gripe about their other latest announcement. We'll see if she at least gives me a straight answer so I can stop waiting.
