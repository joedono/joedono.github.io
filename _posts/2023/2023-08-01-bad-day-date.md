I happened across this concept on the clock app, and realized I had enjoyed this sort of thing a couple times before. So I thought I would record the concept.

The "Bad Day Date" is a date you have with your partner where you both had a horrible day and don't really have any emotional energy to spare for each other, but you still want to spend time together (or you live together and don't really have a choice). You don't really plan anything specific to do. The goal is to make emotional space for each other and have as few expectations as possible. This boils down to the two main expectations in a "Bad Day Date".

First, you recognize that your partner has no emotional energy left to regulate themselves. They will have a short fuse and get angry easily. You recognize that none, or very little, of that anger is at anything you did. That empowers you to cut them infinte slack. You are allowing them to be angry and giving them the emotional space to be angry. Take nothing they say or do personally. Recognize that they still love you and that today they're at their most raw and uncontrolled. Their impulses may hurt you, but you know that's not the real them. It's not the them that they want to be for you. They just need a break.

Second, they have to recognize that you also have no emotional energy left. That means they should have no expectation of getting emotional support from you. They can vent to you, but they should not expect help or problem solving or anything. That frees you from any expectation of "being there" for your partner and gives you space to be angry and bitter at your own day. The two of you should vent all you want. This is the date to air your complaints about your day.

Of course, they should recognize that you have no emotional energy left and take nothing you say personally, and you should recognize that they have no emotional energy left and cannot give you any emotional support today. Basically the reverse of the previous two paragraphs.

This is not the time to air your complaints about each other though. With the two of you completely drained of emotional energy, nothing can really be communicated effectively and your days will only get worse. This is not the date to try to solve any relationship problems and this only works if each of you are TRULY not at fault for each other's bad days. This is the day for you to be angry at the world together. That's the only way this sort of date works. If it does work, it is immensely therapeutic. You both will get through the day and wake up the next day refreshed and with renewed love for each other.

THEN you can tackle any problems in your relationship with each other.
