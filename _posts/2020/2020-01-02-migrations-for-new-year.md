First post of 2020!!

I'm starting the year off with a couple of new projects. Well, "started" probably isn't right, since I actually started working on these late in 2019. But 2020 is going to be their year!! I'm working on: the Hybrids playset (real title TBD), the Weave Character Builder Site, and my sketching.

I suppose I don't really have much left to do with the character builder. I need to test out the method for adding items to a player's inventory without affecting their level. I think I have a workaround for that, due to a bug where the app used to utilize every card in the character configuration during import rather than stopping when it reached enough cards for the current level, but we'll have to see. I already added the random card picker, the die roller, the in-browser character sheet that can be bookmarked, and the various modes for creating, importing, and leveling characters. There aren't that many other utilities to add that won't require networking and proceeding dangerously down the road towards just building the full Weave app in the site. I could do it if I really wanted to. It's not that complicated of an app. The only complicated thing would be syncing character strikes and wounds between players and storytellers. Maybe I'll manage to come up with something new, or maybe I'll just buckle down and actually finish coding the gaming part of the app.

My Hybrids set is coming along. I'm following the same basic process I followed for Iron & Salt: titles, descriptions, mechanics. I'm done filling in titles and basic ideas for all the Talents, Flaws, and Locations, as well as some of the Backstories, Signature Moves, and Themes. I'm still not sure about the tone of the set, but I'm not too worried about that. I'm drawing a lot of inspiration from the Xorte/IO set, since it's basically the same idea. It's a city of misfits where the outside law doesn't apply. There are no rules!

As for my sketching, I've started working on various things from one of my Christmas presents: Anime for Kids. I had the impression from my earlier sketching that I was complete trash at drawing faces, which are what the anime book spends most of its pages on. I'm going to have to replace my normal circle and square drills with face drills. Fortunately, one of the pages in the anime book outlines exactly what I need to do and gives me the perfect outline/shape to repeat and work on. I think my next few pages will be full of face and perspective drills.

The other art-related thing I did was replace my blog gallery with one on DeviantArt. I was getting kind of sick of putting up all these sketches and not being able to share them without either exposing this blog to who knows who or re-uploading the images to Facebook. Since I've kept on with the sketching for 4 months now and I'm still really enjoying it, I think I'm in this for the long haul, so it would pay to have someplace to put the stuff where I can share it with people. So, Little HIVE has a [DeviantArt profile](https://www.deviantart.com/littlehive/gallery/71781222/sketches) now! Go me!!

It was pretty cool getting a bunch of likes and favorites even as I was uploading stuff. I guess there are just lurkers browsing around the "new" stuff and throwing likes out at people.
