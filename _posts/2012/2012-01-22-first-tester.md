title: "First Tester"

I'll be honest, I've never had my games play-tested by someone else before I release them into the wild. I can get away with this because this is just a hobby of mine. I didn't plan on making my older games super polished or profitable, so I never bothered having them play-tested. The other reason is my lack of play testers. I know I could just release it to the internet with a "Hey guyz, check out my game and tell me what you think", but I'd rather avoid the great swaths of "Game suckzorz. You're stupid and should stop living".

So I finally managed to get a good friend to sit down and try The Great Inkscape out while I watched. Man, what an enlightenment. Nothing beats having a fresh perspective who wasn't there when you made the decision to increase the gravity from 0.7 to 0.9 (and doesn't care, frankly). I learned that there was so much I needed to fix. My controls were shit, the player jumped too fast, and having the ink fly in one of two types of arcs was severely limiting. I also got the reactions I was hoping for. My tester literally shrieked the first time she accidentally sprayed a ghost with ink. I had god mode on, so she couldn't die, but the game still scared her! It was awesome!

The moral of this story is, even if it's only one person, have someone else try out your game. It goes a very long way towards making your game better.
