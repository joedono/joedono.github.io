Well, today wasn't all that eventful. Woke up for class this morning and made plans to go to karaoke with people to celebrate our long weekend. I returned to the room and took a long (and much needed) nap. I was woken up by a knock at my door. Some other friends wanted to go to Ikebukuro to celebrate.

We ate dinner at some grill place. They served the meat rare on a still hot pan. That way, you could cook it the way you wanted it. It was quite cool, but I forgot my camera today, so no pictures.

Afterward we got a message from the person heading up the karaoke party saying she'll be late. So we went to an arcade and I got my butt whooped in a fighting game called Melty Blood: Act Cadenza. Then we got another call from the person saying that she'd rather do it tomorrow. With our evenings shot, we returned to the dorm and pondered what to do with the rest of our night.

We were still in a movie mood, so we watched Spiderman 2, which we all appreciated.

In spite of this, it was a kinda disappointing start to the vacation. I plan on going to Yokohama tomorrow because there's supposed to be a great view of the ocean from there.

Oh, and sorry to my family. I forgot to get a microphone again. I will definitely get one tomorrow.
