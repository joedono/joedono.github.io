Another day where I have 20-30 minutes and nothing productive I can do in that short of time.

I've sent off the "final" draft of Iron & Salt to the folks at Weave. I really hope it's final this time. I'm resisting the urge to make more last-minute balance changes after the session I had last night. I wound up flubbing some of the rules in favor of the players , but I think that's just my DMing style. I did that a lot when I ran my D&D sessions too. I just hope this continues to work out and that I don't get cheated or anything. I'm going to be sorely disappointed and jump ship immediately if anything shady happens with this.

But that's all close to behind me now. I'm almost done with the outline for Sia Malak, and I've managed to come up with basic descriptions for things along the way. I still have NPCs, Enemies, Bosses, and Plot Twists to come up with. Basically, breathing life into the world. I have a couple ideas for NPCs, but it's going to be hard to add detailed descriptions to them. Everyone is going to be a new hybrid. I'm probably going to wind up putting together all of the player-facing descriptions, then generating 77 characters with various quirks and talents and making them into the NPCs. The only portion that doesn't cover is spirits and non-lucid creatures. But given a little time, I know I'll find my groove and bang out character after character.

One question I've been wrestling with is whether to leave the NPCs generic or not. Reading through Xorte/IO, most of the NPCs are described just by their occupation rather than making them into named characters with histories. Making them into actual characters has done good things for Iron & Salt. Having recurring NPCs really breathes life into a campaign. Fred the Detective, Wesley the Friendly Werewolf, and Sylvia the Witch have made several appearances in my sessions, and the players who keep coming back are happy to see them. I want to keep that going with Sia Malak, so named characters it is!
