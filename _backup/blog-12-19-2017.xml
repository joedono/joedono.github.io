      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

Dark Cloud. Another game from the "golden age" of early Playstation 2. This was also a very underrated title. This was the time of Zone of the Enders, Bloody Roar 3, Twisted Metal: Black, and (sigh) MTV Music Generator. It was the wild west of game development again, and everyone wanted in on this budding new platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Cloud is one part dungeon crawler, one part Sim City, and one part crafting. The basic story is that an evil (not-Nazi) general summoned an evil power in order to destroy the world. The Fairy King saved the world by putting all the people and buildings into these little spheres and hiding them in caves and forests. You are given a small jewel that can free them from these spheres and bring them back to the surface. You may even be able to rebuild the world better than it was before. So you trek through randomly generated dungeon floors, collecting new weapons and crafting materials and freeing the people and various bits of their homes from the spheres. You bring them back to the surface and rebuild their homes with all the pieces. If you feel like a completionist, you can talk to the townspeople and see if they have any requests for how they'd like their town rebuilt. Someone wants their window to face the morning sun, someone else wants to be close to the dungeon so they can train on the monsters, someone else wants to be far away from the mayor because his giant windmill keeps her son awake at night, and someone else wants to be in the center of town because why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T4UrYvHqK40/VfgxA6cQ3rI/AAAAAAAABG8/VyO54USiFeA/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="180" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T4UrYvHqK40/VfgxA6cQ3rI/AAAAAAAABG8/VyO54USiFeA/s320/maxresdefault.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This was a REALLY fun game for its time. The systems were just deep enough to be interesting and the city building mechanic was brand new and exciting, at least to my never-played-sim-city tastes. I had a lot of fun going through the dungeons and exploring every nook and cranny. I didn't have fun with the weapon system at first though. This was the first game I played with a weapon degradation mechanic. Fight for too long without repairing your weapon, and it breaks and disappears forever. Given how large the weapon enhancement system (I hesitate to call it "crafting") goes, that's potentially a lot of time wasted. Thank god for no auto-save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UqJBmdpy5JU/VfgxA76eenI/AAAAAAAABG4/Nk5qO-iD0RY/s1600/1darkcloud_0604_screen039.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="244" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UqJBmdpy5JU/VfgxA76eenI/AAAAAAAABG4/Nk5qO-iD0RY/s320/1darkcloud_0604_screen039.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The city building system was incredible though. You started with a huge open space with just about nothing in it. You retrieved sections of road, rivers, fishing ponds, houses, people, bridges, trees, misc pieces of houses, and windmills or other buildings. Then you played god with the pieces and rearranged the towns as you liked. You had three progress bars for each town: one for how much you retrieved from the dungeon, one for how much you placed on the field, and one for how happy the townspeople were. Filling the first two bars was required to finish the zone and unlock the next one, but you got some hefty bonuses for filling the happiness bar. At its core, the happiness mechanic was one of those logic puzzles where you tried to figure out who should sit next to who at a party. It was just the thing my teenage brain ate for lunch every day.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3825494019726204487/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/09/game-experience-dark-cloud.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3825494019726204487'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3825494019726204487'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/09/game-experience-dark-cloud.html' title='Game Experience - Dark Cloud'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YD4G_l4DqO0/VfgxA1Cuz2I/AAAAAAAABHA/hppxsDF1mrk/s72-c/Dark_Cloud_PS2_Game_cover.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5336655837562269740</id><published>2015-07-17T14:17:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-07-17T14:17:07.031-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Half Life 2</title><content type='html'>I'm starting to feel like I'm hitting the bottom of the barrel. I'm really struggling to find games that I've played that I have strong memories of. A few of my latest entries were kind of lackluster and were just general ramblings rather than recounting memorable moments from the games I've played.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I never intended to put all that much effort into this. Just wanted something to do during spare time when I couldn't be bothered to work on anything else and got sick of YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kpQEx19zOk/VZv3GLeDehI/AAAAAAAABEs/f3MUwv5gofA/s1600/header.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="298" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kpQEx19zOk/VZv3GLeDehI/AAAAAAAABEs/f3MUwv5gofA/s640/header.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, let's talk about one of the few big ones I have left in my repertoire: Half-Life 2. I mentioned during my Resistance entry that it was the game that really got me started on first-person shooters. That is mostly true. But it was Half-Life 2 (and the Orange Box in general) that really cemented the genre for me. Truth be told, I originally bought the Orange Box just for Portal. I had seen a small tech-demo of Portal's early development and was really intrigued by the concept. So, I bought the Orange Box for PS3 and played through Portal. But that was only 1/5 of the game package and 3 of the other 1/5's shared the title "Half-Life."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eHHk_3zYRZw/VZv3GVeFw9I/AAAAAAAABEo/dgxswcwID10/s1600/half-life-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="256" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eHHk_3zYRZw/VZv3GVeFw9I/AAAAAAAABEo/dgxswcwID10/s320/half-life-2.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I had heard of the Half-Life series before. I remember a particularly gruesome ad in a GamePro magazine of Gordon Freeman killing Master Chief with a crowbar. Back then, I chalked it up as a game that I would never enjoy. It was just in the background, quietly influencing gamers older (and richer) than I was. I didn't realize when I popped the disc in and started it up that I was about to take a vacation into the paradise that PC gaming had been while I was enjoying my PlayStation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-Life immediately defied my expectations by refusing to show me an enemy or hand me a gun until 20 minutes into the game. It gave me a chance to explore what the world had become. I knew that this was a sequel, but I had no knowledge of the events in Half-Life 1. All I knew was that there would be events referenced and characters introduced that I would be expected to know about. I would just have to go along with it. The first thing I noticed as the train pulled into the station in City 17 was that no one noticed that I had literally just appeared out of nowhere. I would later learn that I was wanted by those in power and the rebels had been searching for me for a very long time. Yet, the intro to the game had absolutely no fanfare. None of the other main characters knew I was back until I just about stumbled into their laps on my way to one of the deadliest places in the game. Later, I went back and played the original Half-Life and learned this was par the course for Valve's flagship franchise. The first 20-30 minutes are designed like a horror movie. They establish the status quo of the world in a relaxed setting to allow the audience to get their bearings. This gives all the more power to the inevitable collapse into the nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was that the clocks in the first area had no hands. That was just the first indication of the subtle story-telling I would see throughout the intro that showed just how bad things had gotten for the human race. Very few games I had played up to this point had such attention to detail. I knew I was in for a ride and resolved to keep my eyes open for other similar details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...is what I'd like to say, but I eventually was just sucked into the story and the environments and completely forgot about the finer details. Which I guess was fine for my first playthrough. I did manage to find the G-Man a couple of times, even if I had no clue who he was or why he was significant enough to put in the intro. I finally realized the size of the game during the first vehicle section with the boat. This was the first time I had to navigate a really large environment in a game from the first-person, as well as the first time that I had to solve long-reaching physics puzzles. I reached the part in the game where the Combine closes the gate on you. You have to park your boat and then spend about half an hour navigating through this building to find a switch that will open the gates. By the time I got through it, I had completely forgotten that I even had the boat and why I had come into the building. That's how much attention-grabbing stuff happened inside the building. It happened to me again during the car section when I had to climb under the bridge to shut the force-field off. It was a whole missing unto itself and I completely forgot that my original goal was just to turn off a force-field so I could resume driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SqNMIblU_4Q/VZv3GEOckJI/AAAAAAAABEk/OcR3si1nN2E/s1600/gordon_freeman.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SqNMIblU_4Q/VZv3GEOckJI/AAAAAAAABEk/OcR3si1nN2E/s320/gordon_freeman.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;One other thing I think that made Half-Life 2 special to me was it was the first time I was completely and totally immersed in the world. Gordon Freeman wasn't so much a character in the world as he was...me. Kudos to Valve for accomplishing what they set out to do when they decided to make Gordon a silent protagonist. I WAS Gordon Freeman. That feeling faded a bit when the game was over and I moved on to Episode 1 and 2, but the main game had me believing that I was right there, fighting aliens, saving the world, and shouldering a role as messiah and "The One Free Man" that I neither wanted nor felt I could bear.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5336655837562269740/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/07/game-experience-half-life-2.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5336655837562269740'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5336655837562269740'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/07/game-experience-half-life-2.html' title='Game Experience - Half Life 2'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kpQEx19zOk/VZv3GLeDehI/AAAAAAAABEs/f3MUwv5gofA/s72-c/header.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8523977598117187203</id><published>2015-05-08T13:19:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-08T13:19:23.949-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Rock Band</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6507_kEZSgA/VUzsO6q6biI/AAAAAAAABDw/MJyCq5Tbf1Y/s1600/Rock_Band_logo.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="205" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6507_kEZSgA/VUzsO6q6biI/AAAAAAAABDw/MJyCq5Tbf1Y/s320/Rock_Band_logo.svg.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ah, Rock Band. The game for people who want the experience of being in a band without any of the effort of learning to play, going on tour, and dealing with fans. This game series started when I was in college and was the second biggest reason my friends and I got together to play games (the biggest reason was Super Smash Brothers). We played this game for hours on end and some of us got really good at it. I couldn't sing and I was just ok with guitar/bass. I was awesome at the drums though. I played it so much that, when I bought my own copy of the game, I eventually had to buy a metal foot-pedal plate to repair the plastic one I snapped in half during play. I injured my wrist at some point when I was really in to this game. I'm convinced that I played this game so much during recovery that I doubled my recovery time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lis60u9ky7w/VUzsO74RT8I/AAAAAAAABD4/MbQ_AOiGsoY/s1600/rock-band-2-game-only-20080716002200237.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="177" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lis60u9ky7w/VUzsO74RT8I/AAAAAAAABD4/MbQ_AOiGsoY/s320/rock-band-2-game-only-20080716002200237.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Whenever I got really into a game like this, I would eventually be able to play whatever song the game had designated "hardest" on its highest difficulty, but I wouldn't be able to play the three or four songs right before it. It happened in DDR and again in Frequency. I could play "Won't get Fooled Again" all day, but don't ask me to play "Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld." I could just barely make it through "Painkiller" but not "Shoulder the Plow." I was selectively really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-As8xInLqbr4/VUzsO1UpsLI/AAAAAAAABD0/Wq7YR8UNUzM/s1600/rockbundlehi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-As8xInLqbr4/VUzsO1UpsLI/AAAAAAAABD0/Wq7YR8UNUzM/s320/rockbundlehi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The game had two problems for us though. One was the peripherals. We were college students. We moved between the campus and home during summer vacation and we changed where we lived on campus every year. This game doesn't exactly lend itself well to traveling around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem was more of a theoretical one. We were worried about the music industry as a whole. We thought everyone who played this game was playing it instead of actually learning a real instrument. All those kids (just like us) who would have grown up into the virtuosos and hit stars of the future were wasting their time playing a video game for the same experience. In 10-15 years, the music industry would collapse from lack of talent, all because of this game. Of course, it's been about 10 years since we thought about that, and the music industry still has good talent in it, but it was fun to think about at the time.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8523977598117187203/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/05/game-experience-rock-band.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8523977598117187203'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8523977598117187203'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/05/game-experience-rock-band.html' title='Game Experience - Rock Band'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6507_kEZSgA/VUzsO6q6biI/AAAAAAAABDw/MJyCq5Tbf1Y/s72-c/Rock_Band_logo.svg.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-2174404053868353122</id><published>2015-04-24T09:55:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-28T11:15:20.457-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Critical Depth</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_UXclhN57sQ/VTpDzzz__xI/AAAAAAAABDM/6HrqcNlJYYE/s1600/Critical_Depth_computer_game_cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_UXclhN57sQ/VTpDzzz__xI/AAAAAAAABDM/6HrqcNlJYYE/s1600/Critical_Depth_computer_game_cover.jpg" height="320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The mid to late 90s were an incredible time for the Playstation and a special company called SingleTrac. The company that brought us Twisted Metal 1 and 2 and Jet Moto 1 and 2, four of the most popular Playstation titles, was having a great couple of years. The Twisted Metal franchise is still going "strong" today (cough), and Jet Moto set the stage for anti-grav racing on the Playstation, along with the Wipeout series. Then there was WarHawk. Oh...my...god WarHawk. Now that was a fun game. Unfortunately, the company closed down in 2000 when a group if employees split off to form Incognito Entertainment. So what happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this writer's humble opinion, they made Critical Depth. Take everything you know about Twisted Metal, and put it underwater. That's Critical Depth. It sounds great in theory, but it was kind of a hot mess. It was fun as heck, but a nightmare to control and pretty hard to beat. This is another one that I had to rely on cheats to survive and complete. I blame my young age and impatience for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bWr-NSlS7IU/VTpDz30R82I/AAAAAAAABDI/J7SGoO5go6Y/s1600/Critical%2BDepth-PSX-NTSC-US.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bWr-NSlS7IU/VTpDz30R82I/AAAAAAAABDI/J7SGoO5go6Y/s1600/Critical%2BDepth-PSX-NTSC-US.jpg" height="239" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Critical Depth is a demolition derby game with submarines instead of cars. The goal of each level is not to just destroy all the other subs, but to gather 5 alien pods to activate the portal to the next level. This formula can make for some very intense capture-the-flag type scenarios with one player carefully hoarding all the pods, then the others descending on him as he makes a break for the exit. The story, such that it was, resembled Twisted Metal. Each playable character has a wish that will be granted in some nefarious or twisted way by the deus ex machina at the end of the game. The Calypso of TM fame is replaced by semi-faceless aliens, and your wish is only granted the way you'd like it if you're evil in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only remember a few of the endings. the island natives who wish that people would stop mining their island for petroleum or something. They get put on a tiny island that is the only landmass on the entire planet. The Soviets who want to bring communism to the world are given a machine that "makes everyone part of the same community" by literally sewing them together. The bloodthirsty pirate gets a place in the alien's armada, since all he wanted was a really good fight. And there was a fat dude who was obsessed with being smarter than anyone else. So the aliens gave him a brain that would support that. Unfortunately, he would only survive after the operation for a few minutes. But during that time, he'd be the smartest man in the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that made Critical Depth great for me was the environments. With 3D arenas, the SingleTrac team could really stretch their level design to the limits. There were underwater cities, loads of hidden reefs (that I would shamelessly camp in), and even modern landmarks that had sunk to the ocean bottom. It was beautiful, in a late 90s old-skool 3D sort of way. The one I remember most looked like a sunken New York City. It had buildings with suspiciously large hallways and windows just big enough for the submarines to fit through. Plus, there were a host of other secret areas.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2174404053868353122/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/04/game-experience-critical-depth.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2174404053868353122'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2174404053868353122'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/04/game-experience-critical-depth.html' title='Game Experience - Critical Depth'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_UXclhN57sQ/VTpDzzz__xI/AAAAAAAABDM/6HrqcNlJYYE/s72-c/Critical_Depth_computer_game_cover.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-345016722744655901</id><published>2015-03-27T11:29:00.005-04:00</published><updated>2015-03-27T11:29:59.651-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Wipeout HD Fury</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CoFZnE0SRxY/VRVw5_1Z2ZI/AAAAAAAABCI/guihUu_6y7Y/s1600/1914387-wipeout_hd_fury_cover__cropped_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CoFZnE0SRxY/VRVw5_1Z2ZI/AAAAAAAABCI/guihUu_6y7Y/s1600/1914387-wipeout_hd_fury_cover__cropped_.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Wipeout, one of the most under-appreciated racing game series I've ever encountered. I've seriously seen almost no press or advertising for this series. And yet there are...9 games in the series (not including DLC). I discovered the Wipeout series when Blockbuster and video game rentals were still a thing you went to physical stores for. I rented Wipeout 2097 for the Playstation. It felt like Tron Racing. All wireframes, electrobolts, and shields. The weapons were just points of light with rotating lens-flares around them. Very low-tech as far as realism goes, but this is an anti-gravity racer. I'm sure realism is the furthest thing from the developers' minds. Wipeout HD is currently the newest Wipeout game for a home console. Wipeout 2048 came out a few years ago for the Playstation Vita. Fury is a rather large DLC pack for Wipeout HD that doubles the number of crafts and tracks, and introduces a few new game modes. I bought HD and Fury together, so I'm not exactly sure where one ends and the other begins, but they make an awesome complete package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RXt7lD4fMy8/VRVw6RgNMoI/AAAAAAAABCQ/GxmfOEPrLzQ/s1600/wipeout-hd-fury-screen3-e24675.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RXt7lD4fMy8/VRVw6RgNMoI/AAAAAAAABCQ/GxmfOEPrLzQ/s1600/wipeout-hd-fury-screen3-e24675.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I think of Wipeout as the big boys' version of Mario Kart, or F-Zero for Sony fanboys. All the same racing and gunning but without the cartoon characters and quirky sound effects. Red Shells are Missles, Green Shells are Rockets, Mushrooms are Speed Boosts, and you race around futuristic cityscapes instead of the Mushroom Kingdom or Bowser's Castle. I love both series, but for different reasons. More of my friends are willing to play a quick pickup game of Mario Kart, but I'll play Wipeout whenever I have a craving for solo racing, or when I want to show off what my new widescreen HD television is capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that's the thing about Wipeout HD. The series looks incredible. One of its biggest selling points is rendering at full 1080p and 60FPS. That seems like standard practice now (sort of), but it really shows during gameplay and was incredible when the game came out back in 2008. I suppose its other big selling point is its connection with electronic dance music. The developers repeatedly collaborate with artists such as Orbital, The Chemical Brothers, and Kraftwerk. I had only heard of these artists because I had played Frequency to death, but apparently they're really big in Europe where the underground electronic dance music scene is more popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-apinjre5TvM/VRVw67iqChI/AAAAAAAABCc/12s4cUHeCIA/s1600/wipeout-fury-zone-battle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-apinjre5TvM/VRVw67iqChI/AAAAAAAABCc/12s4cUHeCIA/s1600/wipeout-fury-zone-battle.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But let's talk about the gameplay. The Wipeout series appeals to racers more on the hardcore side of racing games. The physics of anti-gravity racing encourage finding a good racing line during gameplay rather than just shooting your friends when you happen to pick up the Plasma weapon. I spent quite some time learning the structure of the tracks so I could prepare my line 2 or 3 turns in advance. I never went online to play, so I'm not sure how I measure up, but I got all golds in campaign mode, so that's saying something. This design also means that no ship really has an advantage over another. Like most racing games, each ship has different stats for handling, top speed, and acceleration. That just means their racing lines are different. Lower handling can be really good if you're very precise with your racing lines and can use the hard turns effectively. All the new crafts introduced in Wipeout HD Fury have boosted stats, but that only means their racing style is different, not that they're any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8XtU9_47LvI/VRVw5x7s0sI/AAAAAAAABCM/vUU0htpvMkA/s1600/wipeout-hd-fury-ps3-004.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8XtU9_47LvI/VRVw5x7s0sI/AAAAAAAABCM/vUU0htpvMkA/s1600/wipeout-hd-fury-ps3-004.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I didn't fall in love with the Zone gameplay mode like most other people did. The Zone mode is a unique racing mode where there are no other racers. Your only goal is to survive until you get the high score. Your craft is on a fixed accelerator that constantly boosts your speed higher and higher the longer you survive. Every time you crash into a wall, you lose shield and your race ends when your shield runs out. The mode also borrows from Audio Surf in that the track pulses with the music. My personal favorite was Detonator mode. It's a little like Zone in that you're constantly accelerating, but you have to shoot mines in order to get points instead of just surviving. It starts off slow, but can get really hectic and fun the longer you survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man...now I want to play Wipeout again.

Any fighting game enthusiast will go on and on about that one installment of a franchise where they got everything right and nothing will ever be the same again. In reality, it's usually that they spent all their time learning the nuances present in one installment and it's too much effort to unlearn those instincts to fit them to the newer installments. That was Soul Calibur II for me. I pour over guides and practiced endlessly. Then, when Soul Calibur III and IV came out, I was completely lost. How could Namco mess up my formula so badly? Why did they take perfectly good characters and ruin them? The reason is, of course, they didn't. I just didn't want to unlearn what I had spent hours honing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IfvnH7eN-H4/VQgxuDrTFzI/AAAAAAAABBg/EF2gbO4xTZ0/s1600/Soul_Calibur_2_HD_Online_13743691713118.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IfvnH7eN-H4/VQgxuDrTFzI/AAAAAAAABBg/EF2gbO4xTZ0/s1600/Soul_Calibur_2_HD_Online_13743691713118.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Soul Calibur franchise is a series of fighting games. What makes it unique is that it's one of the few fighting games with weapons, and a huge variety of real-world weapons at that. Some of them are a bit of a stretch (I'm looking at your chain-whip-sword, Ivy), but all are based on real life weapons and styles. There's the katana, the straight sword, the quarterstaff, the short sword &amp;amp; shield, the broad axe, the nunchaku, the zweihänder (giant broadsword), the tonfas...you get the idea. What's even more impressive is that each weapon is fairly well balanced against the others. Part of that probably has to do with the even blocking mechanic. You wouldn't really expect someone with nunchakus to be able to block a giant axe swing from a person literally twice their size without any damage, but they can. They can even push back and make the bigger guy stumble. But who cares, right? Soul Calibur was unlike other fighting games in its control scheme as well. Rather than the standard light, medium, and heavy attack buttons, Soul Calibur had horizontal attack, vertical attack, and kick. This made the combat a little more realistic and made it easier to intuit moves from watching other characters. The downside was the lack of those incredibly flashy super-moves one sees in Guilty Gear and Street Fighter. A few characters had them, but only a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ekzyLDlgrDY/VQgxuXoJ99I/AAAAAAAABBo/TPWc6gHulD8/s1600/Soulcalibur_II.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ekzyLDlgrDY/VQgxuXoJ99I/AAAAAAAABBo/TPWc6gHulD8/s1600/Soulcalibur_II.jpg" height="187" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Soul Calibur II was unique in the franchise because it was the first to feature multi-console releases. Each release had a different extra character included. The GameCube version has Link, the XBox version had Spawn, and the Playstation 2 version had...Heihachi? Talk about throwing a cat in with the wolves. I say that, but Heihachi was one of my favorite characters. I had been a long time Tekken fan before this. The inclusion of Heihachi was one of the main reasons I picked up Soul Calibur II. To their credit, Namco make Heihachi a force to be reckoned with. He now had counters and kept the Tekken trademark 10-hit combos. He made up for his short range with his low-dashing attacks and combos. For the others, I've heard that Link was a welcome addition, although the franchise wasn't as popular with the Nintendo crowd. It was even less popular with the XBox crowd, and Spawn isn't even really from an XBox franchise. He's a comic book character. I heard Namco managed to make him pretty awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BCdHv-CCQSM/VQgxt9Tqd6I/AAAAAAAABBc/EC6uIx8o8Ik/s1600/Soul-Calibur-II-Game-Character-Official-Artwork-Render-Cervantes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BCdHv-CCQSM/VQgxt9Tqd6I/AAAAAAAABBc/EC6uIx8o8Ik/s1600/Soul-Calibur-II-Game-Character-Official-Artwork-Render-Cervantes.jpg" height="320" width="221" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was a Cervantes player. I loved the undead pirate for his versatility, gun-sword, and because the guide I was reading said he would be one of the most difficult characters to master. I was a real masochist back then. Cervantes also had a few of the flashier super moves in his command list. He could teleport, fire himself across the map, and had a small gun in the hilt of his shorter sword. I practiced for hours, mastering one combo where I would shoot across the map, fire my opponent into the air, turn around with perfect timing, catch my opponent, and shoot them a couple times before throwing them to the ground. The first move in that combo could be cancelled into one of the flashy unblockable moves too. I delighted in changing at the last minute and catching my opponent off-guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other character that I spent hours practicing with was Ivy. Ivy is the other really complicated character to master. Her chain-whip sword has a dizzying variety of stances and transitions, and she's the only one with a move that requires more than 4 button presses. Calamity Symphony and Summon Suffering are two techniques that require 7 button inputs to perform, but are very high damaging throws involving Ivy breaking her sword apart and shredding her opponent with them. This was the first time I heard the term "buffering." Buffering is a fighting game mechanic that allows players to press other inputs while working their way through an input combo and still have the combo register. This meant that I could press the first two inputs for Calamity Symphony, press an attack button, press another two inputs, another attack button, then do the last inputs and Calamity Symphony would erupt out of my seemingly random combo. If done right, my opponent would thing that I pressed 7 buttons in less than a second. In reality, the inputs started more than 20 seconds ago. It was an incredible rush every time I pulled it off. Of course, the other reason I liked Ivy was because I was a teenager with raging hormones and Ivy was...well...Ivy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My love of this series lasted until I bought Soul Calibur IV. I played for a bit, then I took a real close look at the characters. Then I realized that I couldn't take that close of a look or I would get hurt. Cervantes looked like a kraken spawn, Siegfried looked like he walked out of an ice glacier, Astaroth looked like he walked out of volcanic rock, and Ivy was practically naked. It was too much. I put the series down and went back to Blazblue. But I will always remember Soul Calibur II. The series has only gone downhill since then ;)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4327393862727436840/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-soul-calibur-ii.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4327393862727436840'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4327393862727436840'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-soul-calibur-ii.html' title='Game Experience - Soul Calibur II'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RoE_m3F_fDw/VQgxt0EqK-I/AAAAAAAABBY/ROYSLLzTGag/s72-c/Soul_Calibur_II_logo.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6955460382257250187</id><published>2015-03-16T11:26:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2015-03-16T11:26:37.656-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Breath of Fire 3</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RYu03eV0JAs/VQbtCPQT43I/AAAAAAAABAo/mNaMZr3ANn0/s1600/Breath_of_fire_III_by_Julk3D.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RYu03eV0JAs/VQbtCPQT43I/AAAAAAAABAo/mNaMZr3ANn0/s1600/Breath_of_fire_III_by_Julk3D.jpg" height="226" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"Examine. Examine! EXAMINE!! LEARN THE DARNED SPELL, RYU!!!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wanted to be a dragon when I was little. I mean, the flying and the breathing fire, the magic, the devil-may-care attitude. It was everything I wanted as a kid. Breath of Fire III came out in 1997, the same year as Final Fantasy VII. The Playstation RPG was riding high and just could not be stopped. Prior to this installment, Breath of Fire was on the Super Nintendo and was enjoying the semi-lit spotlight as "that one RPG that people who play Final Fantasy might have heard of," that put it in the same bucket as the Ys series, Chrono Trigger, and Xenogears. All were amazing games, but were overshadowed by the Square behemoth. This is all just my opinion and what I noticed growing up. That said, I loved this game entirely too much. Especially since I've never tried Breath of Fire I or II. I gave IV a go, but couldn't get into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are going to be pretty heavy spoilers to follow, but the game is almost 20 years old. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j7vxFAu-DTM/VQbtCPh2nYI/AAAAAAAABAw/D5ZYOkDz1Yc/s1600/51874-Breath_of_Fire_III_(E)-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j7vxFAu-DTM/VQbtCPh2nYI/AAAAAAAABAw/D5ZYOkDz1Yc/s1600/51874-Breath_of_Fire_III_(E)-2.jpg" height="238" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Breath of Fire III is a turn-based RPG where you play as Ryu, the last descendent of a race of dragons that (supposedly) threatened to destroy the world thousands of years ago before being killed by the goddess. The opening sequence was pretty confusing for my young brain. You play as a newly hatched dragon whelp who, in its confusion, massacres the workers in the crystal mine where it was born. It's pretty dark for a cartoony game, and you don't get the questions about yourself answered for a long time. After being knocked out and imprisoned, you escape during shipment only to turn into a blue-haired boy and be found in the woods by Rei, a beast-humanoid thief and scavenger covered entirely in yellow fur. Rei and his partner, Teepo, take you into their little band of thieves and take care of you until a botched heist lands you on the bad side of the wrong crowd and you are left to fend for yourself in an unfamiliar city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lKRaycNIKIw/VQbtCdO3L6I/AAAAAAAABAs/bAXNsTw-R1Y/s1600/36624-Breath_of_Fire_III_%5BU%5D-6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lKRaycNIKIw/VQbtCdO3L6I/AAAAAAAABAs/bAXNsTw-R1Y/s1600/36624-Breath_of_Fire_III_%5BU%5D-6.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Of all the games I've played, this one has the most character progression. In the beginning, you are an uncoordinated child and you swing your sword like one (literally, your character closes his eyes and flails his sword around in the beginning). After a point, you gain confidence and begin swinging your sword with more force. There's even a time-jump that actually ages your characters. I'd never played a game that did that before. All the younger members of your party get older and their battle animations reflect their new maturity. I think that was the part that impressed me the most about this game. The fact that your battle animations change as the game progresses to reflect the growing skill of the characters. It's a brilliant little touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I really liked about this game was the skill system. Characters could acquire skills in three ways: the standard learn by leveling, be apprenticed to a master, or learn from enemies by "Examining" them. Technically, characters can also learn skills by transferring learned skills from other player characters through the use of Skill Ink. The apprentice-master system and the Examine skill turned this into the second game where I planned out the first 15 levels or so in exhaustive detail to make the next 15 levels that much easier. As soon as I could, I'd apprentice Ryu to the shady wizard character for 2 levels to learn Frost and fight Burn Goos until they taught me Burn. Then I'd switch to the big lumberjack as a master and leave him like that for most of the game. I learned Burn and Frost because the next area after the heist goes wrong has enemies that are really hard to beat without at least one fire spell and one ice spell at your disposal. Ryu was also alone for this part, so you couldn't rely on Teepo, who had filled the role of spell-caster for you so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n1W2OHLXQrM/VQbtCjcEXLI/AAAAAAAABA0/bpPaJKQc548/s1600/gfs_50200_2_3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n1W2OHLXQrM/VQbtCjcEXLI/AAAAAAAABA0/bpPaJKQc548/s1600/gfs_50200_2_3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The really awesome thing in this game was the Dragon Transformation. After a certain point, Ryu acquires his first Dragon Gene. He can use that during battle to transform into a fire whelp dragon. You can acquire more and more genes over the course of the game, and Ryu can mix and match up to 3 to transform into different types of dragons. Most of them are the traditional European type dragon seen in this picture, but there were a number of special transformations too. Wildfire was a lightning quick yellow whelp dragon with low HP but an incredibly deadly counter-attack. Warrior looked more like a dragon version of Ryu, a humanoid with horns, wings and a tail. The Warrior had very high attack power. Behemoth and Tiamat absorbed the entire party into one giant dragon with incredibly high HP and defense. The ultimate form was supposedly the Kaiser form, a yellow version of Ryu with boosted stats. The problem was that the Kaiser was berserk and would randomly attack party members. This was another point where my pre-planning came in handy. One of the monsters you run into in the first area uses an attack called Influence that commands the other party members to attack an assigned target. Since certain abilities cause your party members to go berserk in exchange for increased attack power, Influence stops the worst of it from coming back to hit you in the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I can't go on without bringing up the fishing. RPGs of this era seemed to always include really deep side-quests. Final Fantasy VII had chocobo breading, Breath of Fire III had fishing and the faerie village. The village mini-game thing was pretty cool. It was sort of SimCity lite. But the fishing was where it was at. I don't even really remember if it was necessary or beneficial to the main story at all. I just remember it was so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this game represents the first time I had beaten an RPG without feeling like I had cheesed my way through it. That was one of the biggest shortcomings of Final Fantasy VII and VIII. Once you had the Knights of the Round summon in VII, nothing in the main story could stand against you. And if you had the right party and enough Aura spells stocked up, VIII was an incredible breeze too. Breath of Fire III had no such thing. I fought Myria for over an hour and it was the most intense turn-based combat I had ever been a part of.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/6955460382257250187/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-breath-of-fire-3.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6955460382257250187'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6955460382257250187'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-breath-of-fire-3.html' title='Game Experience - Breath of Fire 3'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RYu03eV0JAs/VQbtCPQT43I/AAAAAAAABAo/mNaMZr3ANn0/s72-c/Breath_of_fire_III_by_Julk3D.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6862327077162338669</id><published>2015-03-13T10:22:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-03-13T10:22:26.377-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Punch Quest</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qDBYfKN3NLE/VQLugsQC_QI/AAAAAAAABAQ/dYOKaLwrQIU/s1600/pqtop.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qDBYfKN3NLE/VQLugsQC_QI/AAAAAAAABAQ/dYOKaLwrQIU/s1600/pqtop.png" height="294" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What a shift this will turn out to be. Punch Quest is (gasp!) a mobile game for iOS and Android developed in 2012 by MadGarden and RocketCat Games. I still play it and still enjoy every second of it. I enjoy it because it's simple, you can play for 5 minutes or an hour without it becoming too stale, and the real money market isn't thrown in your face every few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NaCeb27KnCE/VQLuglJMCKI/AAAAAAAABAM/nLQrC90f4VA/s1600/screen480x480.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NaCeb27KnCE/VQLuglJMCKI/AAAAAAAABAM/nLQrC90f4VA/s1600/screen480x480.jpeg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The formula is fairly standard. It's a two-button side-scrolling endless runner about punching things. You punch ogres, skeletons, bats, wraiths, and zombies. You occasionally turn into a gnome or a rabid goaticorn. You earn Punchos as you play and complete objectives that you can use to purchase upgrades, special attacks, and...hats? Yes, what would a mobile game be without a hat market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, because I'm still playing it and there isn't any sort of character development, it's difficult to talk about highlights or fond memories I've had while playing this game. The only thing that could qualify was when I finally reached the "end" of the game and died to the final boss. I've only ever gotten that far once, and I haven't given up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I could talk about is the effect this game has had on me at this stage in my life. I've been shying away from mainstream games and started exploring some of the lower budget titles. Other than the Resistance series, this is the first game where I have purposely sought out other games by the same developer. I follow MadGarden and RocketCat on Twitter (they even respond to me sometimes!). I have tried out their other games based on nothing more than they made them. MadGarden's Chillaxian was really good and stayed on my phone for quite a while. I played RocketCat's Mage Gauntlet and Hook Champ with similar levels of enjoyment. They're all good quality, but none of them really grabbed me and held my attention like Punch Quest did. I read up on them a little after playing them, and discovered a link between MadGarden and myself. Chillaxian was created during #1GAM 2013 for May (?), the same month that I created Blocks that Grow. MadGarden may not think of himself as a celebrity, but the fact that I found him/her/them through his/her/their work sure makes it seem like that to me.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/6862327077162338669/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-punch-quest.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6862327077162338669'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6862327077162338669'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-punch-quest.html' title='Game Experience - Punch Quest'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qDBYfKN3NLE/VQLugsQC_QI/AAAAAAAABAQ/dYOKaLwrQIU/s72-c/pqtop.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-3703781602768779149</id><published>2015-03-12T13:16:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-03-12T13:16:17.252-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Star Tropics</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nALIbI2Ku3Y/VQG1KGkqTkI/AAAAAAAAA_A/9EItO8ndTwU/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nALIbI2Ku3Y/VQG1KGkqTkI/AAAAAAAAA_A/9EItO8ndTwU/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" height="360" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ah, Star Tropics. This was another NES game that I poured hours of my life in to. I can't actually remember if I managed to beat it without the help of the Game Genie. I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but that didn't make solving the puzzles any easier. This game had some truly convoluted dungeon layout puzzles. But it had some of the best music if any game I played in the early 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yDu3Go2Gk94/VQG1KQC1WwI/AAAAAAAAA_U/BcVuuwLGYkE/s1600/other-consoles-59397-21425697325.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yDu3Go2Gk94/VQG1KQC1WwI/AAAAAAAAA_U/BcVuuwLGYkE/s1600/other-consoles-59397-21425697325.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Star Tropics was a top-down exploration adventure game with fairly clunky combat, an expansive story, and a really cool setting. You are Mike, typical teenager. You go to visit your uncle, an island archaeologist, who has gone missing. You embark on an odyssey around the islands in the South Sea in order to find him. You are armed (at first) with only a yo-yo and your "formidable" baseball skills. Along the way, you'll battle a giant octopus, fire demons, ghosts, aliens, and MANY slugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0reucXoZ1I8/VQG1KOmm5JI/AAAAAAAAA_I/O6NkMXnmFOw/s1600/2362260-nes_startropics.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0reucXoZ1I8/VQG1KOmm5JI/AAAAAAAAA_I/O6NkMXnmFOw/s1600/2362260-nes_startropics.jpg" height="320" width="232" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The first thing I want to talk about is the ancient anti-piracy feature that came with this game originally. The instruction manual came with a letter from your in-game uncle. It was fairly standard family stuff upon first glance, but it came into play late in the game. You unlock new features of your submarine through 4-digit codes. Most of them are told to you in-game. But one essential code requires you to "dip the letter in water." This meant that you had to dip the actual physical letter that came with the instruction manual in water, revealing the hidden code needed to proceed. The magazine Nintendo Power was asked about the code so often that they ended up just publishing the code soon after the game was released. I'm proud to say that we figured out what it meant fairly quickly and without needing to consult any guides. I think I still have that letter. The code might be permanently revealed though. Those things don't tend to hold their effect for very long. This was the first game I had beaten that employed a feature like this, although it wasn't the first I had encountered like this. Sword Quest for the Atari 2600 holds that spot for me. But I credit this game with giving me the tools I would need to eventually beat Metal Gear Solid during the infamous "her frequency should be on the back of the CD case" portion. Thanks, Star Tropics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1OHSfSa7cNA/VQHIUDLWFxI/AAAAAAAAA_w/6ddYJK_y_uM/s1600/startropics-8.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1OHSfSa7cNA/VQHIUDLWFxI/AAAAAAAAA_w/6ddYJK_y_uM/s1600/startropics-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Another portion of the game I remember was the graveyard dungeon. This was one of those where all the rooms looked the same and you had to traverse them in a specific order to proceed. It was really bad because it was full of false exits that would just put you back in the overworld. The entrance was a grave stone that was slightly off-color from the others. It didn't look like a dungeon entrance at all. You just walked over the grave stone and you were in. We spent hours trying to navigate through that place. To the point of putting the game down and not coming back to it for a few weeks. That was the most frustrating part for me. Not to mention that ghost was pretty annoying to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Po89kHazXQ4/VQG1Klu_Z2I/AAAAAAAAA_M/CV4ft4C0QC0/s1600/startropics.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Po89kHazXQ4/VQG1Klu_Z2I/AAAAAAAAA_M/CV4ft4C0QC0/s1600/startropics.png" height="285" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Before finally beating it, I had many false starts playing this game. To the point that I had the first few dungeons memorized and had fought this darned octopus way too many times. But even after all that time, I still died at least once to the false room with the giant pool. You'd think that a teenager running around island dungeons would know how to swim, right? Of course not. Like the older Zelda games, the dungeons in this game were broken up by screen. Moving from one screen to another was an entire transition that couldn't be stopped once started. Star Tropics made use of that unstoppable quality by laying out rooms that were just lava or were just deep water. Entering the room meant certain death and you only had the time it took the room transition to finish to realize your mistake. This made playing the game pretty frustrating, but watching someone else play it incredibly entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My memory of the final stretch of the game is pretty fuzzy. I only actually beat the game once, despite starting it and getting respectably far a half dozen times. I remember something about aliens and the survival of a race discovered by Mike's uncle. I don't even really remember what the final boss looked like. I sort of remember a silly picture of Mike jamming bananas in his ears. What I remember most about the final dungeon is the music. This was another of those games like Final Fantasy VII where I'd set it up, get myself to a safe place, and leave the music on in the background while I did my homework. I do remember the satisfaction I felt when I finally beat the game. Despite my use of the Game Genie, this was a long and difficult game to beat when I was a kid.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3703781602768779149/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-star-tropics.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3703781602768779149'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3703781602768779149'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-star-tropics.html' title='Game Experience - Star Tropics'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nALIbI2Ku3Y/VQG1KGkqTkI/AAAAAAAAA_A/9EItO8ndTwU/s72-c/maxresdefault.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-4095869819468600687</id><published>2015-03-09T10:08:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-03-09T10:08:09.541-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Battletoads</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WcghKwaC-h8/VP2jnrmFrpI/AAAAAAAAA-A/k4zXQuEAeXk/s1600/2361165-nes_battletoads.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WcghKwaC-h8/VP2jnrmFrpI/AAAAAAAAA-A/k4zXQuEAeXk/s1600/2361165-nes_battletoads.jpg" height="320" width="233" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I...loved...this...game. This legend. This jewel. This game...was actually really hard. I'm not ashamed to say that I abused the hell out of my Game Genie in order to play this game, and even then I couldn't actually beat it. I haven't tried it since I was a kid, but I'm not sure I could beat it now either. I believe this was the first game my sister and I could actually play together at the same time. Sure, Super Mario had 2 player mode, but you would switch off. You might as well select single player and hand off the controller every time one of you died. Battletoads put both players on the screen at the same time. And of course, we would argue over who would play the green toad and who would play the brown toad. We wasted hours and hours beating up pigs, rats, crows, giant robots, and (best of all) each other. Thanks to the Game Genie, we played at least the first half of every level. We managed to beat precious few of them together and I managed to beat a few more on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JSPuSPhftl0/VP2lNtSrrMI/AAAAAAAAA-k/ozvoVgIONBc/s1600/battletoads.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JSPuSPhftl0/VP2lNtSrrMI/AAAAAAAAA-k/ozvoVgIONBc/s1600/battletoads.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Probably the thing that made the game the most fun were the "smash hits." At certain points during fights, maybe your fist would get larger, or your foot would grow huge and turn into a boot, or (my favorite) your head would grow ram horns and your hit would send the enemy flying off-screen. Very few other games felt as "heavy" with their hits as Battletoads. The effort put in to figuring out what tells meant that an enemy was vulnerable to a smash hit made the experience all the sweeter. Plus, the cries of "How did you do that!?" from your friends who hadn't figured them out yet (tee hee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7QEertyxmRw/VP2jn406rII/AAAAAAAAA98/WiunZXy6pCk/s1600/54899-Battletoads_(USA)-7.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7QEertyxmRw/VP2jn406rII/AAAAAAAAA98/WiunZXy6pCk/s1600/54899-Battletoads_(USA)-7.png" height="280" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And, like everyone else, I have horrible memories of this terrible level. The damned speeder section. It wasn't the only one of its kind in the game. There's a later level involving surfboards that's very similar and another one with jet speeders that's even worse. But this was the first. The nearly impossible level culminated in a section you would only find today in endless runners that you're not actually supposed to finish. Walls coming at you with no warning with an easily guessable pattern but ever-increasing speed. Between that, and not knowing where the end was, this level was incredibly hard. The only thing that helped me get through it was the knowledge that the fifth wall had a warp hole in front of it that took you straight to level 6. Yes, I knew about all the warp holes. I owned a copy of "Nintendo Games Secrets: Greatest Tips" which had the location of all the warp holes, as well as the secret Contra-like code that got you 5 lives at the start instead of 3. I could get straight to level 8 without Game Genie codes, even if I still couldn't beat any of them past level 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-plC9yJWAMmk/VP2jolbF3wI/AAAAAAAAA-I/S_RuibK5LSA/s1600/Battletoads_cartoon_title_screen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-plC9yJWAMmk/VP2jolbF3wI/AAAAAAAAA-I/S_RuibK5LSA/s1600/Battletoads_cartoon_title_screen.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now, I'm going to wave around my "massive" nerd-cred and forever cement my place as "that guy with that thing." I own a VHS copy of the pilot episode of the Battletoads cartoon series. The pilot was just good enough to warrent a VHS release, but too terrible to give it a full series. It's a good thing that the entire storyline fit into a 20 minute pilot. Nowadays, anyone with an internet connection and passing knowledge of YouTube can watch the episode. But I watched it pre-internet, the way it was meant to be watched. Man, looking back on it now, it really was terrible. Despite being released in the early 90s, this cartoon was full of more 80s-style language than TMNT. I suppose we can blame the era. After the success of TMNT, studios were all set to capitalize on the theory that "kids like anthropomorphic animal superheros." The cable networks were full of things like Street Sharks, Extreme Dinosaurs, and Biker Mice from Mars. And Battletoads was the worst of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least the later games did somewhat better, especially when they started teaming up with the Double Dragon team.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4095869819468600687/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-battletoads.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4095869819468600687'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4095869819468600687'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-battletoads.html' title='Game Experience - Battletoads'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WcghKwaC-h8/VP2jnrmFrpI/AAAAAAAAA-A/k4zXQuEAeXk/s72-c/2361165-nes_battletoads.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7426539417922826756</id><published>2015-03-04T11:54:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2015-03-04T11:54:28.586-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Resistance: Fall of Man</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EP3j_DvPvpA/VPczHXL_PyI/AAAAAAAAA84/3482H_TQpR8/s1600/43.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EP3j_DvPvpA/VPczHXL_PyI/AAAAAAAAA84/3482H_TQpR8/s1600/43.jpg" height="320" width="248" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It isn't a stretch to say that this is the game that got me back into first-person shooters. I hadn't really played anything resembling this genre since Doom 2 for the PC. I was much more interested in the racing, fantasy, and fighting games from the golden era of the Playstation 2. What drew me in to this game was the developer and publisher: Insomniac Games. I had really enjoyed their other famous series: Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank. It had fun characters, unique weaponry, and cool environments. This seemed like a real harsh contrast. The studio that put out cartoon characters was going to make a gritty shooter about fighting aliens and the end of the world? But then again, I knew that the Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank series was starting to experiment with more mature looking environments and characters, so I thought "what the hell?" and gave these guys another shot. Man, am I ever glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, Resistance: Fall of Man looks like any other FPS with aliens. It knows this and still pulls it off fairly well. Imagine what you'd get if Halo was set during World War I, and that's just about this game. What makes this more appealing is that it does away with some of the staples of Halo: regenerating health and limited carrying capacity. Instead, we have the old-school health kits and all the weapons you could want. Even better, Insomniac Games shines through with their weapon design by giving you a host of cool alien weapondry with unique effects that I haven't seen in any other FPS. Sure, your starter machine gun is fairly standard and you get a generic shotgun later. But the alien weaponry is so much cooler. The basic alien machine gun has an alt fire that tags an enemy. As long as the tag is active, normal shots fired will home in on the tagged enemy. This means you can tag a stronger enemy, duck behind cover, then fire around the cover. The second alien weapon you'll get fires slow-moving shots that actually tunnel through cover, and locking on to an enemy will highlight their silhouette when they duck behind cover. My favorite weapon was the Splitter, which I think you don't get until your second playthrough. Its primary fire just shot out a huge shell that traveled slowly for a few feet before shooting forward at high speed. If you pressed the weapon's alt fire while the shell was moving slowly, it would split in two. You could press alt fire to split the two into four, then four into eight, then finally eight into sixteen. So you had a huge wall of bullets ready to mow down an entire hallway full of enemies. The later games got even more unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lw6z5QG03AI/VPczHsGNVzI/AAAAAAAAA88/14QZ8AQgOJo/s1600/playstation_3_resistance_fall_of_man_5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lw6z5QG03AI/VPczHsGNVzI/AAAAAAAAA88/14QZ8AQgOJo/s1600/playstation_3_resistance_fall_of_man_5.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Another thing I really enjoyed about this was the story. Aliens show up randomly in Russia during WWI and start taking over and terraforming the planet so it's much colder to suit their higher internal temperatures. Fine, fine, it's a typical alien invasion scenario. Time to suit up and kick them off our planet. But then you're captured and taken to a conversion facility full of normal people being held prisoner. Of course you escape, but then if you stop and look at what's going on around you, you can watch normal soldiers being converted into the aliens you've been fighting this whole time. The only actual "aliens" you've encountered so far were the little bugs that infected you after you were captured. After you escape, you start to see alien facilities crop up around the world. You are told by your radio buddy that the buildings aren't being built, but excavated. They were already here, buried deep underground. Weirder and weirder. Weirdest of all, and you only find these if you really look, you encounter corpses of solders in black airtight body armor, completely different than any soldier you've encountered fighting on either side of the war. Most of them still have their radios on and there are encoded messages being broadcast. All of this is pointing to some sort of government experiment regarding something called the Chimera Virus. Around this time, I encountered my first giant enemy, so I didn't have much time to theorize about the black ops soldiers. But I knew this was going to be one hell of a story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oAq_wiCO3Y4/VPczHiPu5XI/AAAAAAAAA9E/WXwK0cqzkDU/s1600/185_0_org.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oAq_wiCO3Y4/VPczHiPu5XI/AAAAAAAAA9E/WXwK0cqzkDU/s1600/185_0_org.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Resistance was a really good series, even though I only played the three from the main series on PS3. To my knowledge, Insomniac never finished up the storyline. Each game ended without really ending. The Chimera are still here and we still don't really know where they came from. Maybe more of the questions have answers in the portable games that came out later, but I was never that fond of my PSP and I never thought FPS games lent themselves well to portable systems. Besides, I got into the Half-Life series soon after this one and could not bring myself to go back to a controller-based FPS. I still go back to this series from time to time. I still discover things I hadn't found before. And the boss fights are still some of the most fun I've had playing video games. This series does giant enemies better than almost anything else I've played before or since, second only to Shadow of the Colossus.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/7426539417922826756/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-resistance.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7426539417922826756'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7426539417922826756'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-resistance.html' title='Game Experience - Resistance: Fall of Man'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EP3j_DvPvpA/VPczHXL_PyI/AAAAAAAAA84/3482H_TQpR8/s72-c/43.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8998058021525600337</id><published>2015-03-03T14:18:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2015-03-09T16:45:18.751-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Pokemon Red</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZMGZMKAl7Dg/VPYC8MN331I/AAAAAAAAA8Y/pTCQslfLsYk/s1600/Pok%C3%A9mon_box_art_-_Red_Version.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZMGZMKAl7Dg/VPYC8MN331I/AAAAAAAAA8Y/pTCQslfLsYk/s1600/Pok%C3%A9mon_box_art_-_Red_Version.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The more I write about these, the more I realize that I grew up in a golden age of gaming. Part of it could be that I notice games appealing to my age group simply because my tastes have been changing, but I can't help but feel like the main target audience of gaming as a whole has been my generation and that the popular gaming companies are growing along with us. Pokemon Red/Blue debuted in USA in 1998. I was in 6th grade and I fit the target audience for this franchise perfectly. Not only that, but I had a sister who was also into gaming. So I got the Red version and she got the Blue version. Nintendo came out with a couple more games that were meant to be played in pairs like that, and we were right there to snatch them up when they came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lf4HwW_7zDA/VPYC8IXK1BI/AAAAAAAAA8U/XsUlL5kqR-U/s1600/238964-pokemon_yellow_gameplay.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lf4HwW_7zDA/VPYC8IXK1BI/AAAAAAAAA8U/XsUlL5kqR-U/s1600/238964-pokemon_yellow_gameplay.jpg" height="287" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Pokemon is nothing short of a phenomenon. Everyone has heard the word, even if some still don't understand that it's short for "Pocket Monsters." It spawned an amazing video game series, a hit TV show, an expansive line of toys, a relatively short-lived card game, and numerous community-created media. It was the best reason I had to own a Gameboy and one of the first strategy guides I ever owned. I had the complete gameplay guide and a separate Pokedex guide. I watched the show religiously as well as some of the similar shows that were coming out at the time, like DigiMon and Monster Rancher. I liked the DigiMon series a little more than the Pokemon series. Not being tied to a game series about collecting tons and tons of monsters let the writers characterize the DigiMon characters and monsters more. It just had easier access to better writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember being so proud of my final team of pokemon. This was before any newer types like Dark and Steel were introduced, so I was able to build a team that had a type advantage over any other type in the game without using any of the legendary pokemon. I'm not sure if I can remember all of them though. I had a Beedrill for bug type. There was an Alakazam for psychic type. I either had a Venusaur and a Lapras, or a Wartortle and a Vileplume. I had a Golem for rock and ground. I can't remember what the last one was...maybe an Arcanine? Anyway, whatever it was, I couldn't be beat. At least, not by any of the in-game NPCs. I never got into the multiplayer aspect of Pokemon. I read not too long ago about this thing that professional Pokemon trainers will do where they completely max out the stats on their already-max-level pokemon by having them fight the same enemy over and over for miniscule stat bonuses. The community around Pokemon has definitely gotten older and more mature. They've dissected the system enough to know the most efficient teams and methods of beating other trainers. I stay far away from that crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3oe7kfPbwTY/VPYC8LUmjYI/AAAAAAAAA8c/hdJ82LBTVRk/s1600/11308-bluescreen.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3oe7kfPbwTY/VPYC8LUmjYI/AAAAAAAAA8c/hdJ82LBTVRk/s1600/11308-bluescreen.gif" height="215" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Of course, there were the highlights. Beating the Elite Four was a big accomplishment for me, even though I essentially cheesed the system with my team. Beating each gym leader was a minor accomplishment too. Catching Mewtwo wasn't that big of a deal since I just saved my Master Ball for him. The most frustrating thing was trying to catch a Snorlax. That darned lazy bastard would just use Rest whenever I got his HP down to capturing range and earn it all back again. I could have killed him with a simple command and yet I could NOT catch him to save my life. I also felt like an idiot later. After I beat the Elite Four, I started on the game's secondary goal: Gotta Catch 'em All! The issue I had was that it took me until all the way through my first playthrough to realize how you're supposed to get all three starter pokemon. I begged and begged, but I ended up resetting my progress in favor of getting the starters from my sister. I didn't mind that much, it was a chance to level up the starters through the game normally. And now I had the added bonus of evolving as I went, rather than keeping my starter and a Beedrill the entire game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently, I was part of the crowd that participated in TwitchPlaysPokemon. All the nostalgia I had about this game came rushing back. But I was much more overwhelmed by the sheer number of other people who were participating, theory-crafting, and creating around it than by my own feelings of nostalgia. I had no idea the Pokemon community was still so big and involved. It because less of a novel way to play Pokemon and more of a Pokemon Fans vs. The Internet. A lot of participants were trolls just looking for a quick laugh, but a surprisingly large majority were die-hard fans who actually wanted to progress and see if they could beat the game as a group. I cheered and threw my own little party when we beat the Elite Four. That was a special time.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8998058021525600337/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-pokemon-red.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8998058021525600337'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8998058021525600337'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-pokemon-red.html' title='Game Experience - Pokemon Red'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZMGZMKAl7Dg/VPYC8MN331I/AAAAAAAAA8Y/pTCQslfLsYk/s72-c/Pok%C3%A9mon_box_art_-_Red_Version.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5372493253632547492</id><published>2015-03-02T13:59:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2015-03-02T13:59:16.051-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Amnesia: The Dark Descent</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0HWjJd4uDYc/VPSW6-J5rXI/AAAAAAAAA68/MtMAp3DbuPs/s1600/header.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0HWjJd4uDYc/VPSW6-J5rXI/AAAAAAAAA68/MtMAp3DbuPs/s1600/header.jpg" height="297" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I do not like horror, in just about any medium. I do not enjoy being scared. Ghost stories give me nightmares. I used to think it was all horror, so I took a History of Horror class in college in an effort to cure me of my fears and let me enjoy this genre. All it really did was help me categorize it. Now, I can at least enjoy slashers, zombies, vampires (mostly), and serial killers. But the one thing I can't handle is ghosts or things that behave like ghosts. It's the inescapableness of them. Drag Me To Hell gave me nightmares, and that's Sam freakin' Raimi. I love just about all of his other movies. And don't even get me started on The Grudge or Rose Red. Those were the worst of the lot. Prior to playing Amnesia, the only other horror game I played where you don't have a wall of lead bullets between you and the monster was Haunted House for the Atari 2600, and pixels a half-inch across have a really hard time being scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This game was my attempt to dive into the deep end of horror gaming. This game was touted as the scariest game of the decade, and I believe it. I watched plenty of videos of other people playing and getting scared, and found a picture someone took of the creepy monsters pulled out and put into regular lighting. I read everything I could about the lore of the game without spoiling too much for myself. And then I dove in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm satisfied to report that, not only did I make it all the way through the game, not only did I go back and replay the game to get the other endings, but I also fired up the game one last time and played through the add-on campaign "Justine" that came with my copy of the main game. The final result: I am still scared witless of this game and others made in the same engine and genre. I will likely never play this game again and will never play its sequel. But I did it, I can say that I did it, and I can share my highlights with the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Hv7SxXiZEK0/VPSoQK5XZyI/AAAAAAAAA7c/eIwNJIqjR58/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Hv7SxXiZEK0/VPSoQK5XZyI/AAAAAAAAA7c/eIwNJIqjR58/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My first highlight came soon after encountering a monster for the first time. The game does a fair amount of playing with you in the early parts of the game in the form of illusions of the monster. You'll see one just duck out of sight as you turn around. Try to follow it, and it'll just disappear. I don't think anyone else found what I did, but I turned around and the monster was just behind me, staring me down as if he was about to strike, then he disintegrated. Turned to dust and disappeared. I quickly moved on, not wanting to stick around. I went back through the room I had come from and did a double take at the portrait on the wall. You see, when you see this portrait for the first time, it's clearly a noble gentleman with wrinkled but handsome features. If you go back to look at it while your sanity is low (which mine was after my close encounter) it looks like this picture here. I was petrified. The sense that I hadn't really escaped the monster was unbearable and I promptly downed a sanity restoration potion, which restored the portrait to its former normalcy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ijRPwV_ONM/VPSpJck0o2I/AAAAAAAAA7k/7CTz4v11Cco/s1600/hqdefault.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ijRPwV_ONM/VPSpJck0o2I/AAAAAAAAA7k/7CTz4v11Cco/s1600/hqdefault.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My second highlight was probably the best part of the game, according to the community as a while. The dreaded water monster. You could not see this monster as anything other than splashes in the water. You were save while you were standing on boxes and desks in the hallway and rooms where it lurked, but any steps you took in the water got its attention and while you were actually in the water, it could hurt you. I have this thing about predators that live in the water. I will not play Shark Attack or Depth. Other media about underwater predators don't really bother me, but they take on special horror when they're actually coming after me. While I was battling the Amnesia Water Monster, the same feeling of dread came over me as when I think about encountering a hungry shark in its native habitat. I could not get away from this thing fast enough. Truthfully, I was relieved later on. There's a point where, in order to progress, you have to stand in the water turning a very slow crank to open the next door. In order to prevent yourself from being eaten, you have to throw body parts to other corners of the room to distract the water monster. That point broke my immersion enough that I could get my wits under control. It was a game mechanic that I could learn and exploit. In a small way, I had figured out how to fight the monster. Of course, that feeling was immediately quashed when I got the door open and the monster started chasing me in earnest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tTF9x1b8bn4/VPSW62rp6nI/AAAAAAAAA7E/F0nBeooFSwU/s1600/4802.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tTF9x1b8bn4/VPSW62rp6nI/AAAAAAAAA7E/F0nBeooFSwU/s1600/4802.jpg" height="200" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By this point, I had developed a system that would likely get me through the game. The game probably has three different levels of intensity. The lowest level where your just exploring fairly well-lit areas looking for clues, the middle level where you know there's something lurking around but it hasn't found you yet, and the highest level where you're being actively chased or dealing directly with something horrible. The game spends a good amount of time at that middle level, which was the hardest for me to deal with. So, when that level came up, I would play for about 15 minutes, which was about all I could stand at once, then go watch an episode of TV, then come back to the game. I don't care if that makes me a wuss, this game is scary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nzq-E4mbJkc/VPSr-5bslvI/AAAAAAAAA7w/-TkL-BLD_9I/s1600/goopy-red-stuff.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nzq-E4mbJkc/VPSr-5bslvI/AAAAAAAAA7w/-TkL-BLD_9I/s1600/goopy-red-stuff.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Another highlight I had was any encounter with the shadow monstrosity that's stalking the castle. I'm not talking about the human-sized monsters that actively chase you. I mean the unseen elder monster that's breaking reality to try to get to you, leaving red goop all over the place. The red goop is kind of cheap as far as game mechanics go. Its only purpose is to give you a reason not to go somewhere until some arbitrary time has passed or some obstacles have been cleared. What I loved about it was the concept. I was really in to Lovecraftian horror when I played this. I loved the idea of a creature that warps our perception of reality just by saying hello. That its existence is so completely incomprehensible that just looking at it is enough to drive a person insane. We know from other clues that this particular creature is actually after you because you stole something from it. But we have no idea how important the orb was to this monster. It could have been its alarm clock for all we know. What we're interpreting as it trying to catch you and murder you could just be its panic at the prospect of not being able to wake up in time for work the next morning. Between the completely alien nature of this Shadow and its subtle reality warping abilities, this thing was one of my favorite parts of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EoTtqgt3Pz0/VPSxy_AY5kI/AAAAAAAAA8A/BFd3HOTaxm8/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EoTtqgt3Pz0/VPSxy_AY5kI/AAAAAAAAA8A/BFd3HOTaxm8/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" height="200" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The last highlight I'll talk about was another one unique to my experience. During one of my ventures into one of the castle's basements, I retrieved something from the bottom of a wine cellar (or something) and was headed back to the main lobby of the castle when I discovered a patrolling monster blocking my exit. This was another mechanic that broke my immersion somewhat. I realized quickly that the monster had a relatively fixed patrol route and I immediately shifted into Metal Gear Solid Mode. Here was an obstacle I had faced before. I new how to handle a patrolling enemy, even if I didn't have any means of disposing of it. I scoped out my environment, looking for somewhere I could hide when it went toward the exit, then wait for it to pass behind me on its patrol. A few rooms before the exit, there was a chest-high counter running down the middle of a long room. I waited for the monster to leave out the other side, then ducked behind the wall. I carefully crept along the wall as the monster turned around and returned back the way it had come. When it had left the way I had come, I sprinted past and made my way all the way back to the main lobby of the castle. As I thought about what had just occurred, I realized that I didn't actually see the monster after it had turned the corner and headed for the exit. From the time I crouched behind the wall to sprinting for the exit, I oriented on the monster based solely on sound. I heard its footsteps and the subtle change in music as it got closer, then faded away as it went past me. All I could do was sit there and thing "that was the best stealth I have ever done and I probably will never be that awesome again."</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5372493253632547492/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-amnesia-dark-descent.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5372493253632547492'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5372493253632547492'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/03/game-experience-amnesia-dark-descent.html' title='Game Experience - Amnesia: The Dark Descent'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0HWjJd4uDYc/VPSW6-J5rXI/AAAAAAAAA68/MtMAp3DbuPs/s72-c/header.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-4498169000225199109</id><published>2015-02-26T12:02:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-26T12:02:14.283-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Shadow of the Colossus</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-evvA3s8oK4c/VO9KXX_DdCI/AAAAAAAAA6c/BNJZDmFH5to/s1600/shadow-of-the-colossus-il-buio-di-etherna.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-evvA3s8oK4c/VO9KXX_DdCI/AAAAAAAAA6c/BNJZDmFH5to/s1600/shadow-of-the-colossus-il-buio-di-etherna.jpg" height="480" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now this was a game that tried something different. Debuting in October of 2005, this was the start of my foray into the more artistic side of games. I had just graduated high school and was ready to break away from some of the more mainstream titles. One of the demo discs I had gotten from Playstation Magazine had supposedly included a playable demo of ICO, but the one on my disc caused my Playstation 2 to crash, so I never got to play this game's precursor. Of course, I have since played and beaten everyone's favorite atmospheric escort quest, and I can definitely see Team ICO's evolution between that game and this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story and gameplay of Shadow of the Colossus can be summed up fairly easily. Kill 16 giant monsters as part of a deal with a dark god to revive your dead girlfriend. That's all there is to it. What really sells the game is the environment, the atmosphere, and the design of the collosi themselves. I think the game has a very niche audience. Great portions of gameplay are taken up with just riding around on your horse trying to find the next colossus. It can be incredibly boring if you go into it with the wrong mindset. With the right expectations, however, it can be incredibly beautiful and meditative. Frankly, I think it's a perfect way to offset the intensity of the colossus battles themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qzIUVXh2gFI/VO9KXVeHJeI/AAAAAAAAA6Y/7ZKS6IiDCLU/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qzIUVXh2gFI/VO9KXVeHJeI/AAAAAAAAA6Y/7ZKS6IiDCLU/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've played a few other games where some of the enemies are meant to be really big. The image to the left is to-scale. You can see the player character all the way in the lower left corner. Few other games have managed to pull off giant enemies. The original Half-Life did it with the giant tentacle monster in the rocket silo, but you only saw a small portion of it and stopping to look would get you killed really quickly. Resistance 2 did it with the Leviathan Chimera, but most of the combat there was within cutscenes or far away. God of War did it fairly well, but again, most of the combat there was in cutscenes. Bayonetta did it fairly well too, but the sheer power of the main character meant the bigger enemies didn't feel as threatening. Shadow of the Colossus is still the only game I've played where the giant enemies feel giant and act giant. Where even their average step is enough to cause a small shockwave and send the player tumbling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OgoSiHdR0gc/VO9KXQRwjkI/AAAAAAAAA6g/lHfZgvMjfWE/s1600/shadow-of-the-colossus-hd-w650.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OgoSiHdR0gc/VO9KXQRwjkI/AAAAAAAAA6g/lHfZgvMjfWE/s1600/shadow-of-the-colossus-hd-w650.jpg" height="208" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Actually fighting the colossus is more like a platform-puzzler than an action sequence. Each colossus has a unique series of tasks you have to accomplish in order to access its weak point so you can stab it with your enchanted sword. The second colossus requires that you trick it into using its club-arm to hit a metal plate, which will shatter the guard around its wrist and allow you to scale up its club and make it up its shoulder and onto its head. Another one resembling a turtle requires that you lead it over the geysers in the area so that it's pushed onto its back and you can reach the weak point on its belly. Still another one requires that you lead it on a chase, then shoot at its eyes so it crashes into the wall and you can hit it while it's not digging through the sand. Some of the smaller colossus are a little half-hearted, and there are some that require incredibly specific uses of the environment. But each one is interesting and incredibly fun to fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone's favorite, mine included, is the giant flying desert worm. In the to-scale picture above, it's the one that stretches all the way across the top of the picture. In order to bring it down, you have to ride your horse underneath it and hit a few gas-filled sacs on its underside so that it can't stay afloat and comes to glide along the ground. Then you have to ride your horse on an intercept course, leap off, and grab on to one of its wings. Then it will take off again, and you can make your way around its back, stabbing its weak points until it dives underground to throw you off. It's one of the later colossi that you fight, so you've had ample time to run around the environment and see how big it is. Now you're riding this massive colossus that's flying as high as a jet airliner. You can see the entire landscape stretching out around you, and remember the unique places you've already been. I could point out the desert with the geysers where I fought the turtle colossus, I could see the lake temple where I fought the bird colossus, and I could see a great cloud of darkness where the last colossus waited for me. It was one of the most awe-inspiring moments in my gaming career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER WARNING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another moment while playing this game where I nearly shut the game off and refused to play it again. On your way to fight the final colossus, your horse, Argo, throws you off his back to save you from a falling bridge. The horse has been your constant companion and has been essential in some of your battles. And now he's gone. I cried like a little baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final twist at the end was so of the most brilliant merging of story and gameplay that I have ever seen. Every time you destroy a colossus, a dark energy flows in to you, gradually corrupting your appearance. Upon defeating the last one, your character finally loses himself and is taken over by the dark god. You are turned INTO one of the colossus you've been fighting just as the human squadron that's been chasing you catches up with you. So now you get to see the game from the other side, as a colossus slowing pawing at the noisy humans trying to bring you down. If the music and atmosphere around a colossus corpse wasn't enough to make you feel sorry for killing these beasts that just wanted to be left alone, actually being killed as one will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shadow of the Colossus is a brilliant merging of mood music, environment, and gameplay to create a good ebb and flow of tension and excitement and an all-around meditative experience. Controlling the main character can get a little wonky at times, and the horse can be picky, but I think that just makes the game more believable.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4498169000225199109/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-shadow-of-colossus.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4498169000225199109'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4498169000225199109'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-shadow-of-colossus.html' title='Game Experience - Shadow of the Colossus'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-evvA3s8oK4c/VO9KXX_DdCI/AAAAAAAAA6c/BNJZDmFH5to/s72-c/shadow-of-the-colossus-il-buio-di-etherna.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6961854565966760947</id><published>2015-02-25T09:58:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-25T09:58:45.268-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Alundra</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nAerOKmKJLI/VO3afTdnAqI/AAAAAAAAA50/1BLNi5QIcPo/s1600/alundra_d.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nAerOKmKJLI/VO3afTdnAqI/AAAAAAAAA50/1BLNi5QIcPo/s1600/alundra_d.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ah...Alundra. December of 1997. The golden age of the Playstation.This was a game that my sister became a fan of before I did. She was always more of a fan of the more traditional non-mainstream fantasy games. I was the one who played the more long-standing series. This one, however, I borrowed from her and managed to beat before she did (snicker snicker). I freakin' loved this game and I still tout it as one of the best Zelda-esque games ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BeJWnkCYH48/VO3afV0jz6I/AAAAAAAAA54/Gr7SzCCuWw4/s1600/hqdefault.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BeJWnkCYH48/VO3afV0jz6I/AAAAAAAAA54/Gr7SzCCuWw4/s1600/hqdefault.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The gameplay is practically identical to the earlier 2D Legend of Zelda games. You explore a massive overworld with areas that are blocked by impassible obstacles. You complete dungeons and trials sequentially. Each one contains an item that will allow you to overcome a certain type of obstacle in the overworld and progress to a new area and a new dungeon/trial.You had a lifebar (here represented as red diamonds instead of hearts), you could collect money from fallen enemies and treasure chests to buy optional items, and you had a finite number of equipment slots for weapons and other items. Many of the dungeons had puzzles related to switches and pressure plates that had to be solved in order to progress. A standard formula for this era if ever there was one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9JHZV8vWh_Q/VO3afYlVPKI/AAAAAAAAA6M/IS6pZZTVo7M/s1600/600full-alundra-artwork.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9JHZV8vWh_Q/VO3afYlVPKI/AAAAAAAAA6M/IS6pZZTVo7M/s1600/600full-alundra-artwork.jpg" height="320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The thing that made Alundra really stand out for me was the dark story. I mentioned in my Final Fantasy VII story that I hadn't played any games before that where named characters died and didn't come back. Well, that was par the course in this game. Almost every quest you undertook to save someone's life ended in failure. It was made much worse when the game borrowed from Nightmare on Elm Street and made dreams lethal to the dreamers. In the early part of the game, you discover that you are part of the clan of Elna, a race of Dreamwalkers, who can enter someone else's dream and affect what happens in there. In a world where the gods play a huge role in the lives of everyday people by affecting their dreams, this ability became hugely important to the story. Your journey quickly evolves from helping the residents of this simple village with their troubles to an all-out war with a demon disguised as the patron deity of the village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G8Eh30bB1Ys/VO3af3b7JLI/AAAAAAAAA6E/upsTt4VX2Sk/s1600/hqdefault2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G8Eh30bB1Ys/VO3af3b7JLI/AAAAAAAAA6E/upsTt4VX2Sk/s1600/hqdefault2.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With that in mind, my most vivid memories of this game are the deaths. I even forget the names of most of the characters. The first death is fairly inconsequential. He's the village equivalent of a surfer boy who is seduced in his dream by a succubus demon and killed by a giant blob. You have only passing interaction with him before his death, so it didn't hit me that hard when he passed. The first one that really got to me was the village strongman. I remember that he didn't like Alundra at first. He was on the side of people blaming Alundra for the nightmare-induced deaths that plagued the village since the player's arrival. Eventually, he too succumbed to a nightmare. However, rather than die outright when the nightmare was over, it turned him into a werewolf that you had to slay in front of the entire village. The crushing despair hit the village pretty hard then. It hit me even harder when my caretaker was next to succumb. This was a kindly older blacksmith who took you in after your ship wrecked and you washed up on shore at the beginning of the game. This was the man who made most of your equipment and whose bed you borrowed after a long day of adventuring. By the time the villagers told me that he was having a nightmare, the formula was cemented into my mind and I knew what was going to happen. I'm pretty sure I cried when it was over and had one of those moments where you think about shutting down the game and never finishing the story. But I pushed on and defeated Melzas after some rather complex logic puzzles and a really hard switch puzzle that involved the entire final dungeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare this game to Okami a lot of the time. If you like the gameplay in Okami, then you'll probably like this one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it still has one of the most kick-ass opening themes I've ever heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/skKScoOA3YA/0.jpg" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/skKScoOA3YA?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/6961854565966760947/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-alundra.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6961854565966760947'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6961854565966760947'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-alundra.html' title='Game Experience - Alundra'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nAerOKmKJLI/VO3afTdnAqI/AAAAAAAAA50/1BLNi5QIcPo/s72-c/alundra_d.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6570226546887249809</id><published>2015-02-24T09:44:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2015-03-09T16:50:41.368-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Secret Quest</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0qYdtiMlCik/VOyF-f7rTaI/AAAAAAAAA5g/x-3gihU120g/s1600/1217819231-00.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0qYdtiMlCik/VOyF-f7rTaI/AAAAAAAAA5g/x-3gihU120g/s1600/1217819231-00.jpg" height="320" width="233" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There's something empowering about being able to say that you've experiences some really old and classic entertainment content. My first actual game system was an Atari 7800 that my father owned. The darned thing still works, actually. The Atari gamesystem had three incarnations: the 2600, the 5200, and the 7800. The 7800 was unique because it was semi-backwards-compatible. It couldn't play games for the 5200 because the cartridges were different sizes, but it had the same size cartridges as the 2600, so it could play those games. I have many fond memories and a lot of favorite games from that era. I have never played the infamous E.T., so my memories have almost no tarnish from the great video game crash of 1983. One of my favorites from that time in my life was Secret Quest for the Atari 2600. Not to be confused with Space Quest despite the similar name and Secret Quest taking place in space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ho84kAfKPVg/VOyF9E7ZhGI/AAAAAAAAA5Y/GX0uVq67UPk/s1600/Secret%2BQuest%2B(1989)%2B(Atari)%2B(PAL)%2B%5B!%5D.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ho84kAfKPVg/VOyF9E7ZhGI/AAAAAAAAA5Y/GX0uVq67UPk/s1600/Secret%2BQuest%2B(1989)%2B(Atari)%2B(PAL)%2B%5B!%5D.png" height="320" width="211" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Secret Quest was a top-down 2D adventure game set in a series of abandoned space stations that had been infested with hostile creatures. The objective was to navigate the station, find the self-destruct switch, start the self-destruct, then reach the teleporter exit before the station exploded. The player had an Energy bar that functioned like "Life" or "HP" in that it would drain when you were attacked and could be replenished by picking up energy canisters. The player also had an Oxygen bar that would deplete over time and could be refilled by picking up oxygen tanks. The player could also pick up more and more powerful weapons in each of the stations that would consume more and more of your Energy bar with each use. The game was fairly complex for the time period. Each level had a unique layout made up of square rooms. Each subsequent level had a new unique enemy type and a new weapon for the player to pick up. The details of the levels didn't change at all between levels except for the wall color. But, back then, that was enough to make the world feel a lot bigger than it actually was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fondest memory of this game was when my father dug out all his old notes that he made while playing it. This was the era before GameFAQs and before save files. Your progress in Secret Quest was saved as a unique password that you had to remember or write down and input on your next playthrough in order to resume your progress. Secret Quest was one of the first games to do this. My father, having beaten the game long before I started playing it, had all the passwords recorded in old notebooks alongside the expansive maps of each level. Between the Oxygen bar and the self-destruct timer, there was a huge incentive for the player to complete the level as fast as possible. So, my father created exhaustive maps of every level, where all the items were, where the self-destruct switch was, and where the teleporter exit was. I never had the patience to sit down and beat every level. There were too many other games to play. This was just the first time I had encountered notes that had been made outside the game itself. I adopted that habit for myself for a long time. At least, until games got complex enough that strategy guides started being published.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/6570226546887249809/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-secret-quest.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6570226546887249809'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6570226546887249809'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-secret-quest.html' title='Game Experience - Secret Quest'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0qYdtiMlCik/VOyF-f7rTaI/AAAAAAAAA5g/x-3gihU120g/s72-c/1217819231-00.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1133303033577160339</id><published>2015-02-23T11:01:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-23T16:14:36.291-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Left 4 Dead</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tzxcsZy53fQ/VOs1zzax42I/AAAAAAAAA4Q/p_qtmcchzaI/s1600/Left4dead2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tzxcsZy53fQ/VOs1zzax42I/AAAAAAAAA4Q/p_qtmcchzaI/s1600/Left4dead2.jpg" height="360" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Left 4 Dead was the reason I downloaded and installed Steam. My introduction to the wonder that is Valve had previously been the Orange Box for PS3, and I primarily bought that for Portal. I had seen an early tech demo for Portal online and was extremely excited about it. I had only heard of the Half-Life franchise when I saw it on a few covers of GamePro years earlier. Prior to that, the only FPS I had beaten was Halo: CE for PC. What I'm trying to say is that I was a fledgling PC gamer and my knowledge of Valve was just getting started when Left 4 Dead came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m9QqJRFB_o0/VOs7-FRM_rI/AAAAAAAAA4g/K8MJTgqCEa4/s1600/valve-logo-bald-guy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m9QqJRFB_o0/VOs7-FRM_rI/AAAAAAAAA4g/K8MJTgqCEa4/s1600/valve-logo-bald-guy.jpg" height="230" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I had some money to spare back then, so I took the plunge and bought the Valve Complete Pack on Steam. $100 for the entire Half-Life series, the entire Counter Strike series, the entire Team Fortress series, Day of Defeat, and Portal. 21 games back then, not too shabby. Valve has since added Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Portal 2, and Left 4 Dead 2. It was an amazing second introduction to the world of Valve. I was incredibly excited for Left 4 Dead. The hype surrounding the AI Director, the Co-Op mechanics, and the amazing trailer did their job on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5OrzOwHTbSQ/VOuUI6KjobI/AAAAAAAAA5I/Atx012rMsXE/s1600/Left_4_Dead.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5OrzOwHTbSQ/VOuUI6KjobI/AAAAAAAAA5I/Atx012rMsXE/s1600/Left_4_Dead.jpeg" height="179" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Left 4 Dead is a co-op FPS about four survivors navigating around a zombie-infested world using their wits, working together, and firing more bullets than your average navy squad during an operation. There's Bill, the ex-green-beret with a major chip on his shoulder, Zoey, the zombie movie enthusiast, Louis, the help desk office worker with a never-ending positive attitude, and Francis, the semi-hardened biker who's good with a shotgun and better with the bad jokes. The most surprising thing for me was that Valve managed to make the it fairly believable that these four completely different people could actually work together to survive a zombie apocalypse. In any major horror movie, Francis and Bill would have been at each others throats the entire movie and one of them would end up dead by the others hand before the movie was over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two parts of this game that make it different from other co-op zombie survival games: the special zombies and the AI Director. There were 5 special zombies when the game came out: Smoker, Hunter, Boomer, Witch, and Tank. The Smoker could ensnare a survivor from a distance and had to be killed by a different survivor in order to free its victim. The Hunter could leap long distances and pounce on its victim, also necessitating another survivor stepping in to dispatch it. The Boomer could vomit on the survivors, clouding their vision and drawing a new zombie horde down on them. Upon death, the Boomer would explode, drenching nearby survivors in the same vomit. The Witch would sit still or wander around very slowly, but once startled, would single-mindedly go after the survivor who startled her, doing huge amounts of damage until she was taken down or her target died (on harder difficulties, the Witch could kill in one hit). The Tank was the hardest to kill and could throw cars and pieces of pavement at the survivors. All of these together made your survivor friends completely necessary to finish a level, heavily discouraged running off on your own, and made the special zombies all the more scary for the unprepared. I was caught unawares more than once. I would see a Smoker, have a half-second to register that he was going to ensnare me, and then another half-second to realize that the other survivors were busy battling a Tank on the other side of the map. So, I would just have to wait for a slow death as the normal zombies piled up on me while the Smoker held me trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2ptGBKcSTUo/VOuT6qxux_I/AAAAAAAAA5A/QsWuzlK7WT0/s1600/l4d-horde.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2ptGBKcSTUo/VOuT6qxux_I/AAAAAAAAA5A/QsWuzlK7WT0/s1600/l4d-horde.jpg" height="169" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The AI Director was a construct Valve built to keep the game fresh and replayable. It monitors player input to try and determine average mood and tension. Then it spawns zombie hordes, special zombies, and supplies to keep the tension moving at a good and interesting pace. This means that, with a few scripted exceptions, zombies always spawn in different locations. This worked great...for the first 5-6 playthroughs. of a level. After that it gets sort of predictable. Granted, without the AI Director, the game would have next to zero replay value instead of just middling replay value. All told, it was a great positive addition to the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never got in to the whole multiplayer aspect of the game though. None of my friends played it, so I was stuck with random matches online with players far more skilled and serious than I was (or trolls). After I had my fill of the single-player mode, most of the rest of the world was playing on the hardest difficulty against human-controlled zombies. All the strategies had been figured out and no one used voice chat in random matches. I tried playing it a couple of times, but it was too easily ruined by one trolling survivor who loved friendly fire, two survivors who both thought they knew how to lead the team, or that one AI survivor who just couldn't keep up. I actually played one game where one of the other players was downed a little ways away from the safe area. Rather than just wait for him to die, I went out, killed the horde that was attacking him, and got him on his feet. He responded by gunning me down and then running back into the horde. I would have understood the troll if he gunned me down and then went into the safe house, but he ran away and deliberately got himself killed again. It was the same in Team Fortress 2. At least there you could pick one of the larger games and kinda get lost in your team if you were playing badly. In Left 4 Dead, there was nothing to hide behind. If you weren't as experienced, were having an off day, or were unlucky enough to become the troll's plaything, everyone knew it. I stuck with single-player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think I got my money's worth, even if I only really experienced about half the game. A couple scenes in the game still give me chills. The cornfield is probably the worst in that respect. There are just so many Witches hanging around there. In other areas of the game, you have a rather large line of sight on things running at you, even if they are sometimes around corners. Call it a downfall of setting your game in an urban setting like Philedelphia. Later levels feature the survivors leaving the city after a few botched escape attempts and the game explores a more rural environment. There are fewer tools at the survivors' disposal and many more things for zombies to hide in. The cornfield is about as claustrophobic as the game can get without just surrounding the survivors in fog. The final scene in the airport is another. You have line of sight in almost every direction, but the zombies can come from every direction too, so it's really easy to get cornered or separated from the other survivors. There are a couple of really awesome scenes too. The rooftop of the hospital is one. The little cabin at the end of the forest is another. Truthfully, I remember a lot more of Left 4 Dead 2 than of this game. Mostly because they're completely the same, just with new characters, new maps, and new special zombies (and a killer level at a rock-and-roll concert).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wxK8cYU_u9s/VOtMgMMZxwI/AAAAAAAAA4w/Tn4VEesmP3k/s1600/partone_link.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wxK8cYU_u9s/VOtMgMMZxwI/AAAAAAAAA4w/Tn4VEesmP3k/s1600/partone_link.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The other thing that makes this franchise so awesome is the expanded lore. Valve has put out a number of comics related to Portal and Team Fortress 2. They released "The Sacrifice: Part 1" in 2010. Among other things, this comic included a brief flashback into the lives of each survivor just before the outbreak occurred. Things like this really serve to breath new life into an otherwise dry world. Prior to this, we could only gleam bits and pieces about the survivors and the world from small quips the survivors made to each other and graffiti left by other survivors. From that, all we knew about the characters was what I said a few paragraphs ago, and we know that the zombie outbreak happened like most other zombie outbreaks. The virus (if it was a virus) didn't even have a name. The Sacrifice is a gripping piece of literature. You can read it for free &lt;a href="http://www.l4d.com/comic/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just went back and re-read the sacrifice and discovered something new about the lore. It turns out that the gene that makes the survivors immune is inherited from the father's side. During the outbreak, Zoey had a real touching moment with her father where he's been bit and he reminds her of that scene in all the zombie movies where someone gets bit and the others have to put him down before he turns. I damn teared up reading that part again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left 4 Dead was a great concept that made an awesome game with good replay value and an average multiplayer experience. Maybe I should re-install this sometime...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1133303033577160339/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-left-4-dead.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1133303033577160339'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1133303033577160339'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-left-4-dead.html' title='Game Experience - Left 4 Dead'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tzxcsZy53fQ/VOs1zzax42I/AAAAAAAAA4Q/p_qtmcchzaI/s72-c/Left4dead2.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-2950747015841960497</id><published>2015-02-20T10:29:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-20T18:01:44.520-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Baseball Simulator 1.000</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B-h89VyyJ0k/VOdL7bTuZhI/AAAAAAAAA3k/cMYoxvcWa8Y/s1600/BaseballSimulatorNESBoxart.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B-h89VyyJ0k/VOdL7bTuZhI/AAAAAAAAA3k/cMYoxvcWa8Y/s1600/BaseballSimulatorNESBoxart.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And now we're heading into the distant past. Back to a day when men were men and baseball was played on virtual consoles instead of with actual bats and balls. Baseball Simulator 1.000 was released for the NES in North America in March of 1990. Nintendo was on a hot streak that year. Final Fantasy I and Super Mario Bros 3 had just come out earlier in that same year. Everyone and their brother owned a Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the age before the internet, when Blockbuster was the go-to place for home movie rental and game guides were purchased in paperback from Funcoland or your local bookstore (if you were lucky). I owned a few of those, and I've already mentioned that I read game instruction manuals like normal people read books. Unfortunately, I picked up this game during a Blockbuster branch-closing event when they were selling all their NES games for $2.00 a pop. It's no wonder I ended that year with more than 40 NES games in my closet, most of which didn't have those instruction manuals I loved so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RWRdXuHVc0s/VOdL88alM-I/AAAAAAAAA30/u10afjO6h9A/s1600/2361156-nes_basesloaded.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RWRdXuHVc0s/VOdL88alM-I/AAAAAAAAA30/u10afjO6h9A/s1600/2361156-nes_basesloaded.jpg" height="320" width="233" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Most of my friends at the time who owned an NES and played sports games went with another franchise to get their fix: Bases Loaded. I owned a copy of Bases Loaded 2, but I really hated it. The controls for the outfielders were not nearly as responsive as those in Baseball Simulator. Technically, they were the same. Press right, up, left, or down to target first, second, third, or home base respectively. Then press A to throw the ball to that player, or press B to run there yourself. Of course, it made for some rather funny moments if your first baseman caught a fly ball and then you tried to throw the ball to first base. Your character would happily throw the ball at empty air and your catcher would have to pick up the slack. Another thing that made me frustrated about Bases Loaded was the mismatch between pitching and hitting. The batter could swing at three levels: high, mid, and low. The pitcher, at first glance, could only do the same. But I discovered that I could just tap the direction I wanted the pitch to go and it would only go halfway. It would go between the batter's high and mid position, for example. I could never master it, but of course the AI had no trouble. I despised the game for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4u6-ayPU2NQ/VOdPbtn__AI/AAAAAAAAA4A/cmCR9fMtUC0/s1600/baseball-leagues.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4u6-ayPU2NQ/VOdPbtn__AI/AAAAAAAAA4A/cmCR9fMtUC0/s1600/baseball-leagues.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've avoided the real reason for long enough. The real reason Baseball Simulator 1.000 was better was because the players had superpowers! A third of the pickable teams were part of an Ultra League. They were what you'd expect from a Mario Baseball game. My personal favorite was the one on the far right with the smiling baseball. That was because the fourth batter could run about 3x faster than any other player and because the third pitcher threw sidearm, which everyone had trouble hitting. But everyone in that league could throw Fireballs, Stop Balls, or Swirl Balls. Or they could hit Crater Hits, Super Linedrives, or Earthquake Balls. I had to come up with my own names for them since all the game gave you was a little icon. But almost any time you were up at bat or up to pitch, you could press B or press up twice to activate your special power. Then all bets were off. Almost none of the special pitches were hittable unless you had also activated your special hit, and almost none of the special hits were catchable unless you let them run their course and picked them up afterward. They were amazing! Superheros playing baseball with other superheros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zCybYrVo6bc/VOdL8DcOFfI/AAAAAAAAA3s/clkNXb783q0/s1600/baseball_simulator_1000_gameplay_screenshot_5.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zCybYrVo6bc/VOdL8DcOFfI/AAAAAAAAA3s/clkNXb783q0/s1600/baseball_simulator_1000_gameplay_screenshot_5.png" height="280" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My fondest memory of playing this game was when I got a little older and the NES got relegated to the entertainment system at our summer home after we got a Playstation. I would play Baseball Simulator for hours while the rest of my family was out sunbathing or fishing. It had a "season" game mode where you could play a series of games just like a real baseball season. I remember one of the modes included 365 games, just in case you wanted to play one every day for a year. I was already trouncing other teams in exhibition matches all the time, so I never made it very far through an actual season. I could be remembering this next bit wrong, but I believe that, when you set up a season, you were forced to watch the games you weren't playing in. Of course, that's atrocious game design. Why would you fire up a game, then sit back to watch while it played itself over and over again? I could see that being amusing for a little while, but after a little of that, you might as well just go back to watching regular baseball.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2950747015841960497/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-baseball-simulator-1000.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2950747015841960497'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2950747015841960497'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-baseball-simulator-1000.html' title='Game Experience - Baseball Simulator 1.000'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B-h89VyyJ0k/VOdL7bTuZhI/AAAAAAAAA3k/cMYoxvcWa8Y/s72-c/BaseballSimulatorNESBoxart.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-194996170872196144</id><published>2015-02-19T11:56:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T13:05:10.711-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Experience'/><title type='text'>Game Experience - Final Fantasy VII</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SJZx1QK13k8/VOX7OOHEaII/AAAAAAAAA2c/SkDtIw7KjuU/s1600/header.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SJZx1QK13k8/VOX7OOHEaII/AAAAAAAAA2c/SkDtIw7KjuU/s1600/header.jpg" height="297" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting off the new direction with a bang! Final Fantasy VII. Surely, no other single-player JRPG has been so influential to the gaming industry. Released in the US in September of 1997, this game introduced a great number of people (including myself) to the RPG genre and is responsible for one of Square's biggest financial comebacks since the original Final Fantasy was released 10 years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see, in 1997 I was...I graduated middle school class of 2000. So that would put me as going in to 6th grade when this game came out. It was the perfect time. I had tried Final Fantasy I several years before, but I wasn't old enough to understand menu-based gameplay. All I had up to that point was Mario and Battletoads. So I knew that, in most NES games, A was jump or confirm and B was "do the fun stuff" (attack). With that in mind, my attempt to play Final Fantasy I amounted to pressing A a bunch of times to get past the pesky menus, then holding left (the direction of the bad guys) and mashing B to make my characters whack them with swords until they disappeared and the victory music played. It was a frustrating experience to say the least and I didn't get very far. In 1997, however, I was at the perfect age for understanding some newer game mechanics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ojBSDDdHdgA/VOX-gNigvqI/AAAAAAAAA2o/U765DcCooQ0/s1600/Official_US_PlayStation_Magazine_Volume_1_Issue_1_1997-10_Ziff_Davis_US_0000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ojBSDDdHdgA/VOX-gNigvqI/AAAAAAAAA2o/U765DcCooQ0/s1600/Official_US_PlayStation_Magazine_Volume_1_Issue_1_1997-10_Ziff_Davis_US_0000.jpg" height="320" width="239" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;September of 1997 was also the debut of the North American edition of Playstation Magazine. I had picked up the occasional GamePro issue before this, and one of our local bookstores had a single issue of the UK edition of PSM. When I heard that PSM was coming to North America, I begged my parents for a subscription. I got it. The big draw of the first issue was the new Ghost in the Shell game. Inside the magazine was a small guide to specific sections of a game called Final Fantasy VII. I still had a vague memory of playing Final Fantasy I and when I couldn't own a game, I read up on it. So I read the little guidelet. It mentioned things like raising the Gold Chocobo, getting the Huge Materia, finding Yuffie, and some tips on beating Sephiroth at the end. It was so freakin' cool!!! It was also the first Playstation game I encountered that came on multiple discs. The stage was set, my parents bought it for my birthday, and I embarked on one of the greatest gaming journeys of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the few of you who haven't played this game (WHY HAVEN'T YOU!!!?), the rest of this will have heavy spoilers. For the rest of you, what follows may seem silly or it may remind you of your own experiences with this amazing game. You have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game opens with the camera falling through a starfield for no apparent reason. There's nothing of interest in the night sky until we drop and the scene fades to a girl watching green sparks coming out of some machinery on the wall. She walks toward the camera, and we get an establishing shot of the city of Midgar, a meteor flash, and then the title. I was mesmerized. I had never seen anything so beautiful come out of a computer. The swelling music, the visuals, the rich city life...it was amazing. Then, the camera starts panning into the city again and there are some cuts to a train in motion. A few ragtag characters leap out of the train and take out the guards. Then a large man with a weird looking hand gestures to the train and Cloud, our hero, flips off the train. Then the best thing ever happened. I was given control of my character. What followed was my introduction to a whole new method of story-telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-58CsmKVtsz0/VOYD1OrDNyI/AAAAAAAAA24/w57uJfQDD6o/s1600/nobuo-uematsu-206.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-58CsmKVtsz0/VOYD1OrDNyI/AAAAAAAAA24/w57uJfQDD6o/s1600/nobuo-uematsu-206.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A huge part of my immersion and enjoyment into Final Fantasy VII was the music. Final Fantasy VII was the first game I played that had memorable music, melodies that stuck with you and you wanted to hear again and again. I actually started up a boss fight with Active Time Battle turned off so I could listen to the music while I did my homework (and not have my characters die on me). One of my good friends said "Koji Kondo gave games music, but Nobuo Uematsu gave games ballads." I think it's true. I owe a great deal of my enjoyment of this series to this man. I had the rare privilege of seeing him perform One Winged Angel live with the Video Game Orchestra at Anime Boston in 2010. It was an incredible experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back through the eyes of a more experienced gamer, I realize that the intro does very little to introduce you to the mechanics and nuances of the game. This was the era of instruction manuals, and I would read them the way normal people read normal books. Absorbing them, reading them over and over again, and searching for that little piece of interesting lore in a footnote or character bio. In-game, however, explanations were sparse to say the least. There's a building in the slums of Midgar with NPCs that explain things like save points, magic, treasure chests, limit breaks, and overworld item pickups to you. It's very easily missed and could leave you lost for the rest of the game. There is one non-skippable section where Barret explains how to use Materia, but it's done through a video showing you how to navigate around the menu. Compared to modern methods of introducing the player to mechanics during gameplay, it's not very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next highlight was near the end of storming the Shinra tower. There is a section there with a two-part boss fight on the elevator. The only tip I had at the time was that mechanical enemies are usually weak against Lightning. Only one of my characters at that point had a Lightning Materia. I was not prepared and could not get past that section. I put the game down for about a month, and then started a new game. This became the first game where I meticulously planned for future battles. This time, at first opportunity, I went and grinding out enough gil to buy three Lightning Materias and a whole stack of Antidotes (the other thing that gave me trouble was all the poison enemies in Shinra tower). The feeling when I finally beat the elevator bosses, made short work of the new Shinra President, and was rewarded with the motorcycle minigame was incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This marked another highlight. I had never encountered a minigame before. The concept of a game-within-a-game was completely new to me. Of course, I knew nothing at the time. I still had snowboarding, submarines, and Gold Saucer to experience. Nowadays, there is a whole slew of "sandbox" games that are little more than a large collection of mini-games and side missions. Putting these minigames into any game with a "world" is almost a given. So much so, that they become stale. Final Fantasy VII not only included mini-games, but it worked them into the main story seamlessly. Gold Saucer is the site of some major story points. While the mini-game arcade might not have story significance, the rest of the amusement part did. You even picked up a new and incredibly significant party member here. Gold Saucer was brilliantly designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yrI6ef319ds/VOYJaHKeelI/AAAAAAAAA3I/s4CH6367cJs/s1600/Aerith_Gainsborough.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yrI6ef319ds/VOYJaHKeelI/AAAAAAAAA3I/s4CH6367cJs/s1600/Aerith_Gainsborough.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now we get to shift gears a little and talk about another groundbreaking thing Final Fantasy VII did. I know it wasn't the first game to do this (not by a long shot), but it was the first game I had ever played that involved the irrecoverable death of a main character: Aerith Gainsborough (or Aeris for the North American translation). On my first playthrough, my party since leaving Midgar consisted of Cloud, Red XIII, and Barret. So I was probably not as attached to Aerith as other players might have been. But I got her during the date in Gold Saucer, so I knew that Cloud was attracted to her. When she left after the Temple of the Ancients (another boss that gave me a lot of trouble), I was just as consumed with finding her as Cloud was. Part of it was that my party no longer felt "complete," but most of it was because I knew that Cloud wouldn't stop until he had her back. Then, after fighting all the way up through Bone Village, trekking through the snowy mountains, almost freezing to death, and discovering the Village of the Ancients, we finally get to see Aerith again, face-to-face. Then, in an incredible twist of fate, Sephiroth descends and murders her. I couldn't believe it. I could not comprehend at my young age that a named character on the side of good could actually die in a game. It just...didn't happen. I know now that there are plenty of examples of this happening in games that came out before 1997, but it's the fact that it was the first time I had experienced it that made it so intense for me. Part of me wanted to shut the game down and never play it again. I prowled the fledgling message boards for secret codes that purportedly brought Aerith back from the dead. I even tried one or two of the more complicated ones. Nothing worked, and I trudged on through the story to see if Cloud could ever find peace after that terrible loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it didn't take long for things to go awry again. Cloud is manipulated into giving Sephiroth the Black Materia, and is lost in the ensuing earthquake. The game picks up again following Tifa and friends trying to find where Cloud ended up. And here we have another first for me. The first time a main character is sidelined and another character takes up leadership of the party. The game didn't feel right anymore. Aerith was gone and now Cloud was too. I had to put it back together. As much as I could. When we finally tracked Cloud down in Mindeel, I was so happy it wasn't even funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no more highlights for me as far as the main storyline is concerned. I know there were a lot of fights with the Weapons that were now roaming the world, there was a whole thing with acquiring the Huge Materia, and finally taking down Shira. I even wrote complete guides for some of my friends on how to get a Golden Chocobo. Of course, there was the whole plot twist where Cloud wasn't actually in SOLDIER, that Sephiroth was a clone of an interstellar being that wanted to take over the world, and that the WEAPONS were a product of the planet, but I was too young to understand most of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jy9KUIxMsnM/VOYNyHEptYI/AAAAAAAAA3U/jcyIoxrIFHk/s1600/39140_screenshots_2014-01-16_00001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jy9KUIxMsnM/VOYNyHEptYI/AAAAAAAAA3U/jcyIoxrIFHk/s1600/39140_screenshots_2014-01-16_00001.jpg" height="180" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;No, my final memorable moment was trying to fight this guy. The infamous Emerald Weapon. I had encountered him before when I went to the Sunken Ship to get the Hades Materia. I came out and he was sitting there outside. I encountered him again later on when I needed the submarine for something else. The combination of the underwater lighting and his sheer size was terrifying. Both encounters ended with me surfacing immediately and heading for shore as fast as I could, fearing that he could breach the surface and come after me. Later on, after taking down Sephiroth and reloading my last save file, I resolved to try and take down this green behemoth. This was set to become the most frustrating experience of my gaming career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the first several encounters didn't go so well. I had read many guides on what to bring to the fight. I brought Knights of the Round with W-Summon, Mime Materias, and as many Final Attack-Revive combinations as I could bring. But every time I would get halfway through the fight. Emerald would unleash his Ari Tam Storm and decimate my characters. Once or twice, I managed to somewhat recover, but then he'd use it again. This was the fight that finally defeated me. I went to bed crying and didn't pick the game up again for a long time. It wasn't until many years later that I learned the trick to the fight. I was much older and more experienced. I was trying out a new way of playing Final Fantasy VII that didn't involve loading up my characters with as many Materia as they could carry. It actually gave them a pretty significant basic attack boost. So, when I tried taking on Emerald Weapon again, I brought Barret with me. He only had an HP Boost Materia to make sure he had 9999 HP, and a Mime Materia. I fought hard, and when Ari Tam Storm came again, I learned two incredible secrets. One was that Ari Tam Storm does 1111 damage for every Materia that character has, and the other was the existence of the Lucky 7777 mechanic. Barret now had exactly 7777 HP, which means he went into berserk mode and continuously dealt 7777 damage to Emerald Weapon until it died. A small part of me felt cheated. I did win with an exploit, after all. But mostly, all the years of frustration finally melted away as I looked upon my fallen opponent. I had done it. I had beaten Emerald Weapon. And on that day, I felt I had finally beaten Final Fantasy VII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's my story. Those are the highlights of playing the game that turned me into a hardcore gamer. It was on the long side, but it's a 60 hour game. My sister actually still has a save file with a maxed out timer at 99:59:59. We have no idea how long she's actually been playing. She actually went and tried to find out if there was some secret thing you unlocked if you bred two Golden Chocobos together. There isn't. You actually get a basic chocobo with one of the worst ranks, probably due to all the in-breeding. Next time, my story will probably be shorter. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/194996170872196144/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-final-fantasy-vii.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/194996170872196144'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/194996170872196144'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2015/02/game-experience-final-fantasy-vii.html' title='Game Experience - Final Fantasy VII'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SJZx1QK13k8/VOX7OOHEaII/AAAAAAAAA2c/SkDtIw7KjuU/s72-c/header.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6706086236081371115</id><published>2015-02-19T09:44:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-20T18:03:41.798-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>New Direction</title><content type='html'>I'm going to try taking this blog in a new direction.

It seemed to be too restrictive for me. It would be great if all you had was a story and needed an easy way to get it out, but I thrived on unique mechanics and small arcade games. My stories are usually pretty bad and lack any sort of depth or complexity. However, this time, the story and art are being done by other people. All I have to do is focus on the game development and balance. We've only just started building, so I've been working in a small, pre-made project. Just getting my hands dirty and experimenting with what VX Ace can do. Despite the limitations imposed by the engine, it's remarkable robust and easy to work with, so long as you stay within those limitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, my sandbox environment consists of a world map with a few (non-interactive) towns, defined regions where certain types of random encounters spawn, a single town with NPCs that can be conversed with, a pub with a small bit of main story content, an inn, and some shops. All of this was incredibly easy to put together in an engine that does most of the heavy lifting for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next piece will be to see if I can import external assets and use them instead. From what I've heard, VX Ace is great as long as you stick with what it comes with and the official resource packs available in their store. If you try to import anything that you've made yourself, it's a lot more work to get it to handshake with the engine properly. I tried importing a tileset I got from an RPG Maker XP resource pack, but pieces were getting cut off, half of the tile set needed to be on a different layer so I had to import it twice, and (worst of all) maps are limited to 5 tilesets. That last one means that I can't use any little one-off tilesets without making them part of a bigger file. I probably made a mistake trying to start with importing tilesets. I imagine that importing character portraits or background music would be a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I'm worried about is the restrictive size of the game window. Nearly all of the canned resources restrict you to a rather small window size. I don't remember the exact size, but it's smaller than 640x480. Most of the games I've built have been at least 800x600. It probably won't be that big of an issue, especially for a first try with the engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One really neat feature that I haven't explored fully is the battle preview function. It allows you to sculpt an enemy encounter for the game, then test it on the fly with a specified party configuration. Which will save you the trouble of revamping the game so your party is at the point you want to test, then wandering about until you run into the encounter you want to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another piece I'm really excited about is the script editor. I took a quick look through the Steam Store for some resource packs and the ones they have completely change the look and feel of the game. It was nice to see that I wouldn't have to put in too much work to deviate heavily from the default look the engine provides. Maybe I'll drop $12 and get one of the gritty resource packs to see how it's implemented. It might fit my project better anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm pretty excited about this. I wanted to try out RPG Maker VX Ace for a 1GAM project last year, but I didn't think a month would be nearly long enough to get comfortable with the engine, then construct anything beyond a tech demo. This will be a good opportunity to learn a new engine again.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2742296729955746961/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2014/02/new-engine-rpgmaker-vx-ace.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2742296729955746961'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2742296729955746961'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2014/02/new-engine-rpgmaker-vx-ace.html' title='New Engine - RPGMaker VX Ace'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qec3e8NYW6o/T4A6rjLHGII/AAAAAAAAAKE/-uT7D69yYY8/s72-c/rpgmakervxace.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7949021903406295343</id><published>2014-01-13T11:35:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:53:21.467-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GGJ 2014'/><title type='text'>Global Game Jam 2014</title><content type='html'>Another year, another Global Game Jam.

This will be my New Year's Resolution for 2013." I was never big on the whole New Year's Resolution thing. I get that the new year is special, but you shouldn't wait for a specific time of year to try to make yourself better. That's probably why none of my older resolutions ever worked out. I guess that means this was the first resolution I actually cared about and wanted to see through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else happened this year other than my marriage (which is, by no means, a small event), so 1GAM has a secure place in my memory of 2013. I think my game dev skills have come pretty far since January. Although that's to be expected. Even if you count all of my older projects, I've doubled my game development portfolio and gained experience working with more engines than I care to admit. I've worked with a team and a partner for the first time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original goal was not just to finish 12 games in 12 months. I had spent more time collecting game engines and reading about the latest and greatest techniques than I had actually &lt;i&gt;using&lt;/i&gt; any of those tools. So I wanted to take the first two weeks of each month to learn a new engine and spend the last two weeks actually building a game. Here's where that ended up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January - Gamemaker 8.0&lt;br /&gt;February - XNA&lt;br /&gt;March - Love2D&lt;br /&gt;April - Stencyl&lt;br /&gt;May - Flixel&lt;br /&gt;June - LimeJS&lt;br /&gt;July - Gamemaker Studio&lt;br /&gt;August - Haaf's Game Engine&lt;br /&gt;September - Gamemaker Studio&lt;br /&gt;October - ZGameEditor&lt;br /&gt;November - Gamemaker Studio&lt;br /&gt;December - Gamemaker Studio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed in myself that I let my secondary goal trickle off at the end. That's 4 months that I caved and went back to Gamemaker Studio just for its ease of use and my ability to quickly throw together games with it. I knew I wouldn't have enough projects for everything, but I had originally wanted to work with RPGMaker VX Ace, DreemChest, MonoGame, Sphere, Allegro, SDL, PyGame, Unity, and the Unreal Engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other regret from this year was not participating in more of the community events that happened around 1GAM or that I was invited to because of 1GAM. Even with 12 opportunities, I never did participate in the 1GAM-CRUNCH, the last-minute game jam that happened during the last weekend of each month. I didn't participate in any other jams for that matter. During March and April, I was receiving invites to Google+ Hangouts to talk about developments in the industry like the Ouya and Oculus Rift, and about how other independent and hobbyist game devs organize their projects and stay motivated. I did attend the Global Game Jam 2013 and I fully intend to go in 2014, so there's that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not plan on participating in 1GAM for 2014, although I've read that the event will continue. I have been approached and asked to work on another gamedev project that will likely take up a lot of my time. Especially considering that it looks like the beginning of a full-fledged indie game studio. However, I will keep track of developments on the 1GAM site. I imagine it will keep getting bigger and more interesting and that more and more people will find their place in game development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank my wife for supporting me when I wanted to stop participating (which, admittedly, wasn't very often) and for giving me ideas when my own creative juices had run out. I want to thank GGJ for helping me kick my 1GAM off right. I want to thank VirgiliArt for his contribution to my March 1GAM Project (I still think it's the best game I built this year). Finally, I want to thank @McFunkyPants for creating this incredible event, for being so dedicated to it, and for giving me some personal encouragement when I was the top-scorer for a week and thought it must have been a bug in the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my completed 1GAM profile &lt;a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/FireSpinnerJoe"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and head over to my Projects page to check out the games from this year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been an amazing year!!

This is starting to get tedious. I'm starting to get some more project offers from friends of mine and I have to put them off because I'm devoting time to this. They're being really patient with me, but I'm glad I only have one more month of this. The 1GAM webmaster talked about building a version 2.0 of the site and continuing the event next year. I'll keep track, but I'm probably not going to participate.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4675961980744831627/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/12/1gam-november-basketball.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4675961980744831627'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4675961980744831627'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/12/1gam-november-basketball.html' title='1GAM November - Basketball'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z1iaBx11G5Y/Upuyrt-9-pI/AAAAAAAAAzk/oEOjX7xhvZw/s72-c/Title.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7693628271019975288</id><published>2013-10-15T10:18:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:44:49.132-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>1GAM October - Sweet Sorting</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t8QibTo75Co/Ul1KHnDqtLI/AAAAAAAAAyk/y2YMx6kLXaU/s1600/Untitled3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-llBYSEfMduM/Ul1KHrDbGvI/AAAAAAAAAyw/dm0XmLBRexo/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-llBYSEfMduM/Ul1KHrDbGvI/AAAAAAAAAyw/dm0XmLBRexo/s1600/Untitled.png" height="116" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whee! Another semi-throwaway month! This month's theme for 1GAM was Candy. Appropriate considering the season. I was originally not going to use the theme, but I was running short on ideas that would be feasible with the engine I chose for this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BTeYQVcHHYI/Ul1L-9hgkZI/AAAAAAAAAy4/O2UolvAW4oo/s1600/logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BTeYQVcHHYI/Ul1L-9hgkZI/AAAAAAAAAy4/O2UolvAW4oo/s1600/logo.png" height="102" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The engine for this month was &lt;a href="http://zgameeditor.org/"&gt;ZGameEditor&lt;/a&gt;. This is a 3D game engine, the first 3D engine I've used since trying to learn Unity back in January. It's greatest feature is supposed to be that the executables it exports are 64KB maximum. I gotta say, the engine itself wasn't very easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It operates in a tree structure. The OnStart, OnUpdate, OnRender, and other game loop methods are nodes in a tree that you add components to. One big issue is that all the components are in one big menu. When you go to add a component to a tree, you have to look through ALL the available components to find the one you're looking for. Nevermind that you can't actually add a "RenderMesh" component to the OnUpdate node. Sure, the components you can't use are greyed out, but it'd be better if they didn't show at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I had was that I couldn't figure out how to import external resources. I had a few sounds and models and a different font that I wanted imported into the engine, but when they came in, it looked like they had been corrupted during the export/import process. The game is a lot simpler and lacks some juice because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site says that ZGameEditor lends itself well to games with procedural content or screensavers. The simplicity shows in the engines design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t8QibTo75Co/Ul1KHnDqtLI/AAAAAAAAAys/GzY6HlIGjbQ/s1600/Untitled3.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t8QibTo75Co/Ul1KHnDqtLI/AAAAAAAAAys/GzY6HlIGjbQ/s1600/Untitled3.png" height="250" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In any case, the game! The game is called Sweet Sorting and is extremely simple. Candy is falling from the sky and you have to move the divider to sort each piece into the appropriate bin. Red on the left and blue on the right. There is not scaling difficulty, so even a beginner could play forever. All the models were created from within ZGameEditor itself, so they're just basic shapes. I couldn't figure out how to have a single Model render different Meshes at different positions. I originally wanted it to be falling ice cream. I figured a simple ice cream cone would just be a sphere, and one or two cylinders. But I couldn't figure out how to render the cylinder meshes anywhere other than the center of the model, where they would end up rendering INSIDE the sphere mesh. So I stuck with solid candy. I like to think of them as jawbreakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's it. Another month down and only two more to go. I'm starting to get tired of doing this every month. I'm not nearly as excited as I was in the beginning. However, I am glad that I finally managed to try out all these engines I've been collecting. Next month will be RPGMaker VX Ace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, submitting this game put me back in 2nd place on the 1GAM High Scores board. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/7693628271019975288/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/10/1gam-october-sweet-sorting.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7693628271019975288'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7693628271019975288'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/10/1gam-october-sweet-sorting.html' title='1GAM October - Sweet Sorting'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-llBYSEfMduM/Ul1KHrDbGvI/AAAAAAAAAyw/dm0XmLBRexo/s72-c/Untitled.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6261174518731991510</id><published>2013-09-11T23:13:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-11T23:13:34.330-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>TOP SCORE!!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vUKSw8Qk1pU/UjEvHA2-M5I/AAAAAAAAAwY/9k5lYcYa0Aw/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="408" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vUKSw8Qk1pU/UjEvHA2-M5I/AAAAAAAAAwY/9k5lYcYa0Aw/s640/Untitled.png" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, that's no joke right there. That screenshot is taken from 1GAM's high scores page and you're looking at this humble developer's comfy place at the very top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1GAM's greatest feature is the achievement system. I've always been a believer that gamification is a good way to improve the performance of people in almost any organization, but 1GAM is the first time I've actually participated in something with achievements that wasn't, you know, a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1GAM awards achievements for a variety of things: building each game, building multiple games in a row, posting a link to your blog, to your DeviantArt profile, your NewGrounds profile, your Google+ profile, your Kongregate profile, joining a game jam, posting a review of another 1GAMmer's game, posting sales figures for your 1GAM game, giving an #IndieHighFive to a fellow developer, etc, etc, etc. Each achievement has a point total associated with it, and you level up at certain point totals. I submitted my September game early this month, and I had enough other achievements that it shot me to the top of the high score board!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I had thought there was some sort of calculation error, especially because the guys in 3rd and 5th place have already finished 12 games. I thought there was no way I had more points than them. Then I remembered a new set of achievements that was introduced around June: points for submitting a game that came from the optional theme for any month.

After sorting it out and proving that it was not a fluke, McFunkyPants had this very encouraging tweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very proud to be part of this event.

This month's title was Filling in the Music. This month's engine was C++ &amp;amp; Haaf's Game Engine. Now that this whole thing is over, I have one thing to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I MISS DYNAMIC LISTS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. I've never missed a feature more than I missed dynamically allocated lists. C++ does have a vector class that is supposed to fulfill this purpose, but I didn't have enough time to figure out how to use it. So I had to work with static arrays where I kept track of the last active index. I made the arrays big enough so that they'd never fill up, but I have no idea what kinds of memory leaks the final program had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I think about it, nearly all my trouble this month came out of not having experience with C++. I wrestled with header files and classes before deciding to just put all my code into one big file. I lost hours of work trying to figure out why my method parameters weren't being passed correctly. And don't even get me started on the pointer logic. I still don't fully understand it. What's up with not having a good number-to-string converter? I couldn't even output things to the log file because I couldn't figure out an easy way to convert numbers into strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, the game is up and playable. It doesn't have sound and it doesn't show you your score, but it is semi-playable. You can check it out over on the Projects page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect next month's project to be even simpler, since I have a lot of other things to focus on during the month.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/6716666267774600331/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/08/filling-in-music-post-mortem.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6716666267774600331'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6716666267774600331'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/08/filling-in-music-post-mortem.html' title='Filling in the Music - Post Mortem'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Yvm1S3lkI0/UiJIujbWZaI/AAAAAAAAAvw/-zrDvhwszmk/s72-c/Untitled.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-2813070054149461293</id><published>2013-08-25T23:41:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:45:09.204-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Filling in the Music - Halfway Done</title><content type='html'>It's been a rough month. I haven't had much time to work on 1GAM. I finally managed to make some progress despite Final Fantasy XIV launching this past weekend (my first MMO!! Yay!!). I'm keeping this game really simple, which means I've managed to get about halfway done with just a couple days work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NYsA9fx3E9Y/UhrM0p84vFI/AAAAAAAAAvg/srfcBuogv0o/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NYsA9fx3E9Y/UhrM0p84vFI/AAAAAAAAAvg/srfcBuogv0o/s320/Untitled.png" height="320" width="303" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The game has a fairly complex algorithm for generating the holes that the player has to fill in. I could have gone with pixel perfect collision. The game area is only 400x400, but I wanted this simple concept to have some challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level generation works like this. The game generates a series of squares at random intervals that grow at a set rate. These form the "positive" squares for the game area. In the screenshot, these squares are a greenish-blue and have red Xs in them. The problem comes when I have to generate the "negative" space that will be used for collision and score calculation. This space cannot have any overlapping boxes. The boxes I have so far are black with white Xs in them in the screenshot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take all the "positive" boxes and create "events" for their tops and bottoms. Then, I start at the top of the game area and create a negative box that spans the area. I extend that negative box down until it hits an "event." If the event is the top of a positive box, I split the negative box into two new negative boxes and continue growing them. If the event is the bottom of a positive box, I combine the two boxes that hit it and start growing that one. Now, there is some special logic for when the positive boxes overlap, which is where I'm currently having trouble. I've got it worked out, but it's harder to implement in C++ since I don't know it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I've got the level generation to the point where it processed top events without too much trouble. After I get it processing bottom events, it will be easy to process player input and calculate score. The final piece will be adding sound. I'll probably use a piano scale and pick a random note every time the player creates a new box.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2813070054149461293/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/08/filling-in-music-halfway-done.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2813070054149461293'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2813070054149461293'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/08/filling-in-music-halfway-done.html' title='Filling in the Music - Halfway Done'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NYsA9fx3E9Y/UhrM0p84vFI/AAAAAAAAAvg/srfcBuogv0o/s72-c/Untitled.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-3502514367173979828</id><published>2013-08-05T22:20:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:45:18.692-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>August 1GAM - Beginning</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hge.relishgames.com/_/hge.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://hge.relishgames.com/_/hge.gif" height="48" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've got my idea for August 1GAM. I wanted to build something extremely simple, yet with one challenging aspect, and I found it. The title is Filling in the Music, and the toolset is C++ &amp;amp; Haaf's Game Engine. I dabbled in C++ for a little while, back when I was positive it was supposed to be the be-all-end-all of programming. I learned that it isn't really a good place to start for a complete novice unless you're sure this is what you want to do. Not to mention that, the way my career ended up, it wouldn't have been the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I'm not here to debate the pros and cons of a language I've barely used. I'm going to try it out this month and see how easy things are. I've heard good things about Haaf's Game Engine. It's a bit on the older side, but that won't stop me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of the game is essentially just filling in holes. The game will randomly generate square holes that may or may not overlap and will be different sizes. Clicking inside one of the holes will create a square that grows until it hits the edge of the hole. The player will have to position their growing squares and time when they create new ones to fill in as much of the space as possible before overlapping with the edge. Short, but sweet. And it has that one challenge I was looking for. Generating the level to the precision that I need is going to be kinda tough. I'll have to generate squares that grow for a specified number of steps. Then I have to convert the negative space around those squares into more squares that don't overlap. THEN I'll present the level to the player. I'll be able to check collisions against the negative squares and I'll be able to use the fact that they don't overlap to calculate the area the player has to cover, along with how much they end up covering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to try to adhere to the February 1GAM Theme: Sound, by making the square creation sound effect tonal and pleasant to listen to over and over again. I'll probably end up downloading a piano scale and using that or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's the idea. I'm one weekend deep into August, and I'm not going to have any time this coming weekend or the weekend after, so finding time to work on this is going to be a challenge. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3502514367173979828/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/08/august-1gam-beginning.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3502514367173979828'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3502514367173979828'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/08/august-1gam-beginning.html' title='August 1GAM - Beginning'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-4848028762775986113</id><published>2013-07-30T20:53:00.004-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:45:26.007-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Future Plans</title><content type='html'>I'm writing this in the hopes that a plan for the rest of the year will materialize from it. I'm 7 out of 12 games deep into OneGameAMonth. I've stuck with my original plan to go though the toolsets and engines I have collected over the past 2 years and try them out on a different project each month. I've had great success and only kind of cheated once (GameMaker 8.0 in January and GameMaker Studio in July). I have 5 months left and 5 engines in my original list that I haven't tried yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;MonoGame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C++ (SDL, HGE, or Allegro)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dreemchest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RPGMaker VX Ace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ZGameEditor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The dilemma I have is that I'm getting married soon (yay!!!). I'm predicting that the month before will be mostly spent planning and worrying and the month of will be more of the same. I've gone through all the engines that I had any familiarity with. I've worked a little with HGE, but only to see if I could make a block bounce around the screen. If I'm going to continue through 1GAM, the two games for those months will have to be really simple and made with an engine that is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RPGMaker is right out. I'd actually like to build something reasonable with that one. I've been thinking of dropping MonoGame, since it's directly descended from XNA. ZGameEditor is a possibility. I've used it a little before and it lends itself to simple games. HGE is another possibility, but it's closer to the libraries I'm used to so I'd be able to build something more complex. I have no idea how Dreemchest will work, but the fact that it's visual AND based on Lua might give me an edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do drop MonoGame from my list, that leaves an opening where I could use an engine I already built a game with. If I want to keep them unique, I could pull out PyGame again. It's been a while since I wrote The Great Inkscap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to drop one of the other libraries from my list and maybe use it on a future project. I'll cheat a little and use GameMaker Studio Professional the month I'm actually getting married, and C++ with HGE the month before. I'll keep RPGMaker on my list since I actually spent money picking that up (it was on sale though). Finally, I'll use MonoGame, Dreemchest, or ZGameEditor for the last slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I plan on taking a long break from game building. I'll put some serious time and thought into my next project and not hurry.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4848028762775986113/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/07/future-plans.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4848028762775986113'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4848028762775986113'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/07/future-plans.html' title='Future Plans'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7839467255485819004</id><published>2013-07-28T17:35:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:45:32.710-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Bear and Hunter - Post Mortem</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--IimVRcOHZ0/UfWKWK9pdnI/AAAAAAAAAtE/DRprKL106M0/s1600/Title.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--IimVRcOHZ0/UfWKWK9pdnI/AAAAAAAAAtE/DRprKL106M0/s400/Title.png" height="300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My entry for 1GAM July is finished a whole 3 days before the deadline.

It's a fun little thing that nicely distills the excitement I get when playing Capture the Flag and being chases by the entire opposing team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scottishgames.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/gamemaker-studio-logo_yoyo-games.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://scottishgames.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/gamemaker-studio-logo_yoyo-games.png" height="264" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This month's engine was GameMaker Studio. I had gotten my start with GameMaker 7.0 back in college and I made my first *real* game in it. I actually spent the $30 to upgrade to the pro version, despite being a poor college student at the time. I used 8.0 for my January entry at GGJ2013. Earlier this year, GameMaker Studio was put on sale through Steam, so I picked it up, predicting that it would be a nice piece of software that I'd want to use again. Having to launch it through Steam is a bit of a pain. There were times when Steam thought it was still open after I closed it and refused to open up a new instance unless I completely closed and re-opened Steam again. In spite of that, I knew the engine fairly well and was able to avoid many problems and bugs I would have left in had I made this 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a lot of art from &lt;a href="http://opengameart.org/"&gt;OpenGameArt&lt;/a&gt;, but managed to draw the Bear myself. OGA is a great site. I had a hard time remembering who I got art from for the credits screen, so I hope no one gets upset. There is also the issue of mismatched styles. The tileset I'm using comes from two different people, the cabin comes from another, and the hunter sprite from yet another. The game still looks better than if I had tried to do the art myself, but I miss having a dedicated artist. Maybe another month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest challenge this month was finding time to work. My life is getting busier and I'm having fewer and fewer weekends per month to devote to building. Not to mention that Final Fantasy XIV is coming out soon. The end of the year is going to be hard. But, I didn't think I'd make last month either (I kinda didn't, but at least I could play my game) and I debated giving up the project several times just to make things easier on myself. But I'm in this until the end and I'm going to do my best to keep this momentum going!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Download a copy of Bear and Hunter &lt;a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/yqz5qns8ubpo220/Bear_And_Hunter.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/7839467255485819004/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/07/bear-and-hunter-post-mortem.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7839467255485819004'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7839467255485819004'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/07/bear-and-hunter-post-mortem.html' title='Bear and Hunter - Post Mortem'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--IimVRcOHZ0/UfWKWK9pdnI/AAAAAAAAAtE/DRprKL106M0/s72-c/Title.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8889873055719168072</id><published>2013-07-06T17:16:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:45:40.403-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Starting off strong</title><content type='html'>It's only been one day since I decided on an idea for this month's project. I think it's due to the familiar toolset. I'm also hitting up &lt;a href="http://opengameart.org/"&gt;OpenGameArt&lt;/a&gt; for my art assets this time around. The selecting is okay. I'll definitely have to settle and have a bunch of things that don't go together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8D8qEAuIiCk/UdiHkep3G4I/AAAAAAAAAsk/82IvE5xeYgo/s1600/spr_Cabin_0.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8D8qEAuIiCk/UdiHkep3G4I/AAAAAAAAAsk/82IvE5xeYgo/s320/spr_Cabin_0.png" height="249" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;However, I have been developing my Inkscape skills, so I can at least make some...stuff that sort of goes together with the things I found. Take this cabin, for example. Ripped it straight off of OpenGameArt.org. It absolutely does NOT go with the tileset I'm using. However, it does go with the bear that I managed to pull together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EE5HXqKEizI/UdiHmsaYeTI/AAAAAAAAAss/ah0lJ0QwjTw/s1600/Bear.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EE5HXqKEizI/UdiHmsaYeTI/AAAAAAAAAss/ah0lJ0QwjTw/s320/Bear.png" height="320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Eh?

I'm going to be returning to an old favorite of a toolset: GameMaker Studio. I got it for 50% off on Steam this year. I've used GameMaker 8.0 earlier this year in 1GAM and previously on some older projects, so I have no excuse like I did last month or in April, where I was limited because I was learning an unfamiliar toolset while on a project deadline. I should actually be able to produce something with a little quality this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inspiration for this game was an old game we used to play in Judo practice, back when we had enough people to make it fun. The game was called Bear and Hunter. The rules were two players would sit on opposite sides of the dojo. One was the hunter and the other was the bear. The bear couldn't move until the hunter touched them. The hunter had to crawl, but the bear could stand up and run. The hunter had to crawl towards the bear, touch him/her, then crawl back to the other side of the room as fast as they could. The bear won if he caught the hunter and put him into a pin. The hunter won if he got back to the other side of the dojo. The hunter could also win by pinning the bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to recreate the feeling I get while playing Capture the Flag in any FPS nowadays. That rush when you have the flag, and the entire other team is bearing down on you, but you can see your home base and it's just sooooo close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That makes up the basic idea for this game. I want it to be a little on the humorous side. You'll play as a hunter, who is just minding his own business, when, one night, a giant brown bear steals all of your clothes. Every morning, you'll have to journey through the forest and into the bear's cave to retrieve some of your clothing. Of course, the bear won't let you go without a fight. As soon as you have a piece of clothing in your hands, the bear will give chase, and you'll have to make it all the way back to your cabin before he catches you. Mechanically, the game will be a 2D procedural side-scroller. Since I already know how GameMaker works, I can spend the majority of my time this month learning how to make a procedural platformer (finally).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1849026608654269440/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/07/1gam-july-gamemaker-studio-bear-and.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1849026608654269440'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1849026608654269440'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/07/1gam-july-gamemaker-studio-bear-and.html' title='1GAM July - GameMaker Studio - Bear and Hunter'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7044266106419964961</id><published>2013-06-28T00:19:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-28T00:19:02.894-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Rant About Project Hosting</title><content type='html'>I had thought that Google Code had it all. Sure, the interface was a little shoddy. But the fact that you had one place to host your version controlled source code (which could support Mercurial, Git, or Subversion) and another where you could host downloads for the distributable of your project made it the best free total project hosting solution I had ever seen. I couldn't understand why you would choose GitHub or BitBucket over them and be locked into one version control software and be responsible for your own distribution.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, Google has done it again. They've taken a service that doesn't fit with their "normal" business model and discontinued it. First it was Google Reader, which will be totally shut down after this weekend. Now, they've started taking down the downloadable piece of Google Code. I can see where they're coming from. The ease of use means ease of abuse. However, now that they've gotten rid of the only thing that made hem better then the other guys, this humble developer is making the jump to GitHub. Lets see how this works out. I've been meaning to learn Git anyway...&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/7044266106419964961/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/06/rant-about-project-hosting.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7044266106419964961'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7044266106419964961'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/06/rant-about-project-hosting.html' title='Rant About Project Hosting'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7186219030077776785</id><published>2013-06-27T20:59:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:45:54.104-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Bently's Post Mortem</title><content type='html'>Man, this has just been a terrible month. Mostly because Google has (yet again) decided to phase out a feature that I use. I can no longer host runnable project files on their site. Google Code has removed the Downloads tab from all new projects. I can sort of understand it. They're essentially giving people free reign to people to host any kind of file they want on their servers. It's a policy ripe for abuse. So, it looks like I might end up switching to GitHub and devoting a folder in my project to a compiled version so people can just download it and run it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge issue is that the LimeJS compiler doesn't work for me. I tried downgrading my version of Python to 2.7 and going through the source code of the compiler to fix it, but I just didn't have the patience for tools that don't work the way they're supposed to. I may end up getting flak for not posting a completely playable version of the game, but there's nothing I can do. I'm going to be busy from now until the deadline, so my deadline is effectively tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to pull out the vast majority of the features I had planned. Bently's Chemistry Lab has been reduced to a small touch game designed to teach people the symbols on the Periodic Table. There's nothing to give the game juice except a few sound effects. I'm incredibly disappointed in my performance this month. I think I'm running out of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably also has to do with trying to learn LimeJS on the fly too. The library leaves a lot to be desired. It's so completely different from anything I'm used to. I can safely say that I'm not going to be using this library again. Even using SDL would have been more developer-friendly than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's that. Another month out of the way. I'm really disappointed that I've now had 2 throwaway months this year. However, there was bound to be more than one. Another thing I'm disappointed in is that it looks like I'm going to be the first to have his game posted for June on the 1GAM website. Unless there's something wrong with the site and McFunkyPants is waiting until the end of the month to show the June entries. Whatever. I'm just glad this month is over and I can move on to something a little easier to work with. I started learning GIT at work, but I may still use Google Code for source hosting.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/7186219030077776785/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/06/bentlys-post-mortem.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7186219030077776785'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7186219030077776785'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/06/bentlys-post-mortem.html' title='Bently&apos;s Post Mortem'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7939377852042200572</id><published>2013-06-11T22:26:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:46:01.191-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>1GAM June - HTML5 and LimeJS - Bently's Learning Lab</title><content type='html'>We're almost halfway there! It's a new month, and that means a new engine and a new theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myabandonware.com/media/captures/G/gertrudes-secrets/gertrudes-secrets_1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www.myabandonware.com/media/captures/G/gertrudes-secrets/gertrudes-secrets_1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This month's 1GAM theme is Education. I had a little difficulty getting inspired for this month, until a friend reminded me of all the educational DOS games I had played when I was younger. One of my favorites was Gertrude's Secrets. It's not really an educational game, per se, but it taught me a lot about how to think logically and how to spot patterns. Plus, it was fun as hell. It wrapped logic puzzles into a sort of dungeon crawler interface. You carried Gertrude the goose around the map. When you dropped her off in a puzzle room, she'd fly around and set up the puzzle for you. Solving the puzzles got you closer to the credits room and the world editing rooms. It was a fun little game, one that I felt comfortable I could put my own spin on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to choose an engine. Eventually, it came down to HTML5 or GameMaker Studio. I didn't want to go back to familiar territory just yet. I decided to save GameMaker Studio for a month where I wasn't quite as busy and I could afford to put some real effort into my game like I did in March with Crypt Crawler. So, I ran through the tutorials on HTML5 and settled on using LimeJS. Unfortunately, as I studied and learned what LimeJS could do, I started to realize that it was far more suited for mobile games and mouse interfaces. Plus, being an unfamiliar toolset, I had to scale my game idea back a bit. Gertrude's Secrets was a simple game, but I needed to go simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uwfz2wg4ras/Ubfa7tRml2I/AAAAAAAAAq8/nO1rXPPhyB4/s1600/Screenshot.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uwfz2wg4ras/Ubfa7tRml2I/AAAAAAAAAq8/nO1rXPPhyB4/s320/Screenshot.png" height="320" width="275" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I came up with Bently's Learning Lab. Keeping with the theme of Education, this would be a simple, mouse-driven, game of match. A word or phrase would display on the screen along with 3 symbols or pictures that could match it. The player would have to select the correct symbol/picture before time ran out. The subjects would be The Musical Scale, The Periodic Table, and North American States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still feels a bit like I'm phoning it in for this one too, but life has started getting in the way of this resolution more and more lately. Not to mention my loss of motivation this month. LimeJS has some resemblances to Flixel in that you just have to place an object on the scene and it's drawn for you. I'm still used to manually calling an object's "Draw()" function and having finer control over it. Maybe I'll ask one of my more artistically inclined friends to draw me a character spritesheet for Bently, if only to give the game some unique flair.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/7939377852042200572/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/06/1gam-june-html5-and-limejs-bentlys.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7939377852042200572'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/7939377852042200572'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/06/1gam-june-html5-and-limejs-bentlys.html' title='1GAM June - HTML5 and LimeJS - Bently&apos;s Learning Lab'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uwfz2wg4ras/Ubfa7tRml2I/AAAAAAAAAq8/nO1rXPPhyB4/s72-c/Screenshot.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-2538766070934386521</id><published>2013-05-30T21:41:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:46:07.028-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Blocks that Grow - Post Mortem</title><content type='html'>It...is...accomplished!!! I've never appreciated tight deadlines like I have with this project. I banged out the bulk of the features in the past 2 days and had to cut more corners than I have on any other project. Right now, I'm so glad this is done. Blocks that Grow is finished. You can check it out on the Projects page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What went right&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools. I haven't built a game in a coding tool with code completion since February, and I missed it. Flixel is definitely a library I will use again. A big chunk of the game involves the player being pushed around by the moving/growing platforms. I was not looking forward to writing that stuff all over again. Turned out, Flixel handled that out of the box. I was able to bang that out in an hour. And FlashDevelop was incredible for a free tool. I highly recommend this toolset to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deployment. I keep asking myself why I didn't pick up Flash sooner. The fact that I can build a game, put it online, and anyone can play it regardless of platform is astounding. I know Flash is starting to lose ground to HTML5, but I don't see it disappearing anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What went wrong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the only thing that went wrong this month was life getting in my way. I had 2 weekends this month where I wasn't near a computer. That's a lot of lost development time. If my idea had been any more complicated, I don't think I would have finished. I don't think I have any other months this year that will be this hectic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it was a pretty good month. I'm starting to feel the drag. It's getting hard to keep motivated month-to-month. I blame the long break I took last month, but I think it was necessary. I still have a good number of toolsets to try out this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MonoGame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HTML5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C++ and SDL or Haaf's&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RPGMaker VX Ace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GameMaker Studio Professional&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DreemChest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So that's...3 strict coding libraries, 2 game builders, and 1 builder with a heavy scripting component. I'll probably do what I did this month and hold off on choosing an idea and a toolset until I get the optional 1GAM theme and let the inspiration come naturally. The good news is that, other than RPGMaker, I am pretty confidant that I can build whatever I want with any of the other engines. DreemChest is Lua based, which I got my fill of in March with Crypt Crawler. I've worked extensively with GameMaker before (built my very first complete game in it). C++ is the only language there I've never worked with. So it's going to be an interesting year.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2538766070934386521/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/05/blocks-that-grow-post-mortem.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2538766070934386521'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2538766070934386521'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/05/blocks-that-grow-post-mortem.html' title='Blocks that Grow - Post Mortem'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-3206839527882781941</id><published>2013-05-19T16:53:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:46:12.603-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Everything's Easier with Flixel</title><content type='html'>Once more, I am pleasantly surprised by the toolet I am using. I was prepared to spend this entire weekend building growing moving platforms. I've tried to implement moving platforms in the past, and normally, they are one of the most difficult pieces of platforming. However, with Flixel, nearly all the work is already done. A quick call to the right collision-checker, and almost all cases are taken care of. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell through these screenshots, but I'm not up for posting videos just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TQaoz_TK2d0/UZk6p_LYqWI/AAAAAAAAAn8/QshPtgEQXHk/s1600/Screenshot01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TQaoz_TK2d0/UZk6p_LYqWI/AAAAAAAAAn8/QshPtgEQXHk/s640/Screenshot01.png" height="521" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The extra simple graphic I've drawn for the growing platforms&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LvpwqXFgdD4/UZk6we2SDeI/AAAAAAAAAoE/kmbIKwqq2A8/s1600/Screenshot02.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LvpwqXFgdD4/UZk6we2SDeI/AAAAAAAAAoE/kmbIKwqq2A8/s640/Screenshot02.png" height="522" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;After being hit by the bullet, the grower will start sending out platforms.

Especially because FlashDevelop includes IntelliSense code completion. There are a few nuances of ActionScript that have taken me a while to get used to. Mostly, it's the placement of the type declarations. In most of the other languages I've worked in, the order goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;,Courier,monospace;"&gt;&amp;lt;access modifier&amp;gt; &amp;lt;returnType&amp;gt; &amp;lt;functionName&amp;gt; &amp;lt;parameters&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;,Courier,monospace;"&gt;public int DoThingsWithNumbers(int num1, int num2) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in ActionScript, there's an extra word, and the return type goes at the end:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;,Courier,monospace;"&gt;public function DoThingsWithNumbers(num1:int, num2:int):int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been multiple times where this has tripped me up with syntax errors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But enough about that. Here are some screenshots!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9I9TVmnzOvw/UZGsg5BJUMI/AAAAAAAAAl8/0xofWMN96_4/s1600/BtGScreenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9I9TVmnzOvw/UZGsg5BJUMI/AAAAAAAAAl8/0xofWMN96_4/s640/BtGScreenshot1.png" height="522" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A basic playing area.

The month is almost halfway done, and I'm coming up on what will be the most difficult feature to implement: the Growing Platforms. Flixel has a relatively good collision library. I don't think I'll have trouble making the platforms push the player. The complicated part will be letting the player ride on the Growing Platforms. Moving Platforms in general have historically been the hardest feature to implement in a 2D platformer, right up there with slopes and ladders. Fortunately for me, they're the last and only complicated piece of this game, other than actually designing the levels to be fun, that is.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/9209609061755561355/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/05/blocks-that-grow-progress.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9209609061755561355'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9209609061755561355'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/05/blocks-that-grow-progress.html' title='Blocks that Grow - Progress'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9I9TVmnzOvw/UZGsg5BJUMI/AAAAAAAAAl8/0xofWMN96_4/s72-c/BtGScreenshot1.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-380977647158707656</id><published>2013-05-01T17:17:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T10:00:00.617-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>1GAM May - Flixel - Blocks that Grow</title><content type='html'>After a whirlwind of a time last month and an extended break from game development, I'm ready to dive in to this month's 1GAM. The optional theme is "Grow." It seems like the themes get broader and broader every month. The good news is that this one went from hearing the theme, to basic inspiration, to a full fledged game mechanic in just under 3 hours. The only month that had a shorter inspiration time was January, and I was at GGJ for that month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toolset for this month is &lt;a href="http://flixel.org/"&gt;Flixel&lt;/a&gt;. A flash-based library similar to XNA, if the tutorials and documentation I've been looking through are any indication. It already feels better to work with "real" code. If you'll recall, I was less than satisfied working with Stencyl last month. There was a division between the idea that I wanted to build, the way I would build it normally, and the way I would have to build it to get Stencyl to do what I wanted. Having a general lack of good inspiration may have factored into that. Not to mention that I was utterly spoiled by an actual artist for March. I tried coming up with my own art in April, but it just wasn't happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month, my concept lends itself extremely well to very simple graphics. The working title of my 1GAM entry for May is "Blocks that Grow." It will be a Single Screen Puzzle Platformer. You have your player, you have a goal, and you have platforms that you can jump around on. The twist for this one is that there will be "platform seeds" and "platform fertilizer" in the levels. The player will be able to pick up the fertilizer and throw it in straight lines at the seeds. When the fertilizer hits the seeds, a long platform will start growing out of the seed. It will grow until it hits a wall, wait for a few seconds, then start retracting back towards the seed. Horizontally growing seeds can be used by the player as a sort of conveyer belt and vertically growing seeds can be used like elevators (at least, the ones that grow up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may add hazards or more general "moving platforms" if I have time. But for now, it's 5 levels of single-screen puzzle goodness. The player is likely to just be a white blob that rolls around or has legs. Something extremely simple and cute.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/380977647158707656/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/05/1gam-may-flixel-blocks-that-grow.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/380977647158707656'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/380977647158707656'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/05/1gam-may-flixel-blocks-that-grow.html' title='1GAM May - Flixel - Blocks that Grow'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-4905614433884580533</id><published>2013-04-09T21:54:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:47:20.082-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Ant Drops and Stencyl</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lhYLlv6BJ9w/UWS7K0d_O4I/AAAAAAAAAb8/AOajD27fgHI/s1600/TitleScreen.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lhYLlv6BJ9w/UWS7K0d_O4I/AAAAAAAAAb8/AOajD27fgHI/s320/TitleScreen.png" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After only 2 hours of work, I have completed my April 1GAM entry: &lt;a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/615087"&gt;Ant Drops&lt;/a&gt;. It's...well, to put it bluntly, extremely simple for me. You are an ant. Your mission is to catch acorns. If one hits the ground, you lose and are sent back to the title screen. Seriously, compared to last month's project, this almost wasn't worth the time. However, I believe that the fact that this only took me 2 hours to make means that I've evolved to another level of game development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who frequents comic book conventions. He carries a sketch book with him. While he's at the convention, he makes a point of visiting the talented artists that are there to sign autographs and promote their work. Instead of asking them for their autograph, he asks them for a sketch. He's told me that most of them only take about a minute and a half to sketch out a quick drawing. Looking at the quality of some of these sketches, I almost can't believe they were done in that short of time. With this game, as simple as it may be, I feel I have reached that level of mastery. I know I still have a long way to go, but it's a real comforting thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ldFiuJun0es/TXhGdHZ2WaI/AAAAAAAAAMw/lfQ7pjZ6UC8/s200/logo_500.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ldFiuJun0es/TXhGdHZ2WaI/AAAAAAAAAMw/lfQ7pjZ6UC8/s200/logo_500.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I used Stencyl for this project (which may have contributed to the extremely short development time). I have to say that I was not impressed. On my project page, you will note that the entry for Ant Drops includes "9 Days of agonizing brainstorming." I went through around 4 different ideas for games. Each time, I had to shelve the idea because Stencyl didn't support a feature I needed for that idea. First, I wanted to resurrect the Candlehead idea, but Stencyl doesn't support changing an actor's collision bounds without scaling the sprite. Then I wanted to make a basic 2D Action-Platformer (kinda like Castlevania or Spelunky), but I couldn't figure out how to make a character swing a sword with its own hitbox. It is very likely that I've just become used to the freedom that coding by hand gets you that I couldn't deal with the constraints using a game builder puts on you. Even building Ant Drops, I had to spend 20 minutes crafting a moderately complex "if" statement that would have taken me around 30 seconds if I were coding by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't want to write Stencyl off completely. There was a lot of stuff I didn't have to think about when building Ant Drops, like collision handling and scene transition. The pre-made game starter kits and resources/assets available at StencylForge have a&amp;nbsp;ludicrous&amp;nbsp;amount of potential. The free version only limits what platforms you can publish to, unlike GameMaker which limits the number of resources you can have in your game. Stencyl is built on top of Flixel, which is on my list of toolsets to try out this year. There's a good chance a better understanding of Flixel will make me more comfortable with Stencyl. At the very least, I'll be able to code around any limitations in the Stencyl drag-and-drop framework. Out of the 12 projects/months that I'll be building this year, I have toolsets for 10 of them. There's a moderate likelihood that I'll come back to Stencyl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: At time of writing, I have the 48th highest score on the OneGameAMonth website. That's out of almost 5000 developers. WOOHOO!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4905614433884580533/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/04/ant-drops-and-stencyl.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4905614433884580533'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4905614433884580533'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/04/ant-drops-and-stencyl.html' title='Ant Drops and Stencyl'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lhYLlv6BJ9w/UWS7K0d_O4I/AAAAAAAAAb8/AOajD27fgHI/s72-c/TitleScreen.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5144399435757756268</id><published>2013-03-30T23:01:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:47:28.571-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Crypt Crawler - Post Mortem</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--RwQzpT5u5Y/UVeo4dSV-sI/AAAAAAAAAbU/a5c2bWXNy0c/s1600/1GAM+Icon2.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--RwQzpT5u5Y/UVeo4dSV-sI/AAAAAAAAAbU/a5c2bWXNy0c/s1600/1GAM+Icon2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've pretty much finished everything I set out to do on Crypt Crawler. There are a few features I listed as "nice-to-have" that I didn't get to, and a few suggestions from my artist that I won't be able to put in. Overall, though, the game came out REALLY well. You can download it over on the Projects page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Went Right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://love2d.org/style/logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://love2d.org/style/logo.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distibution&lt;/b&gt;. One of the biggest issues I had last month was that XNA requires some extra stuff on the player's computer before they can play. Not to mention that it's Windows only. I understand that it's meant to build XBox games, but that wasn't what I was targeting. Love2D, on the other hand, is a much smaller library with much fewer dependencies. Add to that simple, step-by-step guides to making standalone executables/app packages and distribution with Love2D becomes trivial. Now, I still don't have a Mac, so I can't compile for distribution, but I feel a lot better about sending people to Love's website to download the program for their platform than bundling a giant install into my extremely simple game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collision Management&lt;/b&gt;. It seems a little specific, but I feel it's worth mentioning. This is the first time I've built a game using a third-party collision management library. In this case, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua"&gt;Bump&lt;/a&gt;. Now, there were a few hiccups that I've mentioned in previous posts. But once I got it set up the way I wanted, setting up collisions for a new entity type was a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.projectmanagementguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/trello.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www.projectmanagementguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/trello.jpg" height="66" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team Building and Productivity Tools&lt;/b&gt;. I brought in an artist this month, and boy am I glad I did. I took a crack at some of the sprites early on in development, and the first drafts that came out of the artist's printer blew mine out of the water. The game actually looks like a GAME thanks to my artist. Considering that he lives in another state, we had to pick out online productivity tools to share content and keep tasks up to date. I have experience with &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; on previous projects. I love it so much that I use it for just about all my projects. Even those that I'm working on alone. It makes for a really good motivator late in development when your "Done" list starts to become longer than your "To Do" list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://goodlogo.com/images/logos/google_drive_logo_3963.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://goodlogo.com/images/logos/google_drive_logo_3963.png" height="155" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For actual sharing of content, I decided it would be a waste of time to educate my artist on Subversion and the sublties of a version control system, but we still had to share content. I suggested DropBox, but he was more familiar with &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/"&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;. It was fantastic. Our needs were simple, so there was no way we could really go wrong, no matter what we chose. The feature of Google Drive that was most useful was highlighting of updated files. If my artist made changes to something, 4 times out of 5, he didn't get a chance to tell me, because it was so easy to tell when he updated something. I know I could have subscribed to changes, but I actually didn't have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Could Have Gone Better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debugging&lt;/b&gt;. Lua suffers a lot from lack of an IDE with a good debugger. I was forced to write my code in Notepad++ and, more than once, I was faced with a bug that would have been a lot easier to solve if I could pause execution and inspect the variables. Ironically, a couple Love2D-specific IDEs came out this month. I didn't want to take the time to learn a new set of tools when I was already learning so much this month. Maybe for another project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third-Party Libraries&lt;/b&gt;. This was more a shortcoming on my part than anything to do with the software I was using. All told, my project leverages the Bump, MiddleClass, and AnAL libraries for Lua. I made the mistake of looking for the library to fill a specific need as the need arose. Looking back, I could have just gotten a general purpose game-building library like HUMP or Zoetrope and used that. Less to learn, but more to use. Again, maybe for another project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language Oddities&lt;/b&gt;. First off, tables are 0-indexed and should always be 0-indexed :P. In all seriousness, the fact that Lua tables are 1-indexed tripped me up more times than I care to admit. I also couldn't seem to wrap my head around the whole tables/metatables business. If I hadn't used a library like MiddleClass, I would have been completely lost. To me, game coding essentially equals Object Oriented Programming. So I have a hard time adapting to a different paradigm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final Evaluation - Love2D?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will I ever use Love2D again?&lt;/b&gt; That will largely depend on where my life goes. Love2D is EXTREMELY portable. I can have all the tools I need to code in it at under 30MB (plus whatever I use for graphics and sound effects). As things stand right now, I have a very stable work station at home. My desktop computer isn't going anywhere, and I'm home more often than not. If my life changes so I'm spending a lot of free time in front of computers that aren't mine, then yes, Love2D will become my go-to game building engine. For now, however, I finally have an excuse to take it off my thumb drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ldFiuJun0es/TXhGdHZ2WaI/AAAAAAAAAMw/lfQ7pjZ6UC8/s1600/logo_500.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ldFiuJun0es/TXhGdHZ2WaI/AAAAAAAAAMw/lfQ7pjZ6UC8/s200/logo_500.png" height="87" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's next?&lt;/b&gt; I'm not sure. I have a basic game idea that I could use for next month's project, but I'd rather wait for the next theme. The theme comes out in a couple days and waiting for that springboard served me well this month. As for the toolset, I think I'll give &lt;a href="http://www.stencyl.com/"&gt;Stencyl&lt;/a&gt; a try. I used GameMaker 8 for January, and two raw-coding engines for February and March. I think it's time to try out one of the game-builders again. I'll probably miss having version control, but I did go all this month without a debugger.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5144399435757756268/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/crypt-crawler-post-mortem.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5144399435757756268'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5144399435757756268'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/crypt-crawler-post-mortem.html' title='Crypt Crawler - Post Mortem'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--RwQzpT5u5Y/UVeo4dSV-sI/AAAAAAAAAbU/a5c2bWXNy0c/s72-c/1GAM+Icon2.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5063056279039870642</id><published>2013-03-20T21:59:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:47:36.863-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>ART!!!!!</title><content type='html'>Back in January, I attended Global Game Jam 2013. In the course of working on our entry (Ventricle Assault), there was a point where my team collectively just sat and stared at our game. We had just added the background to the main play area. We realized then that we were making a real game. Our...thing, had stopped being just a bunch of shapes shooting at each other and looked like something we'd find on the shelf in a game store (in the 80s, but still made by people paid to make it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell &amp;nbsp;you this because I just went through a similar experience with Crypt Crawler. My artist has turned Crypt Crawler into something that resembles an actual game. I now have to struggle not to have too much fun playtesting so that I can keep developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CdEH86-3w8Y/UUpnNg5RfaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/CjvWNMRndvM/s1600/Screenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CdEH86-3w8Y/UUpnNg5RfaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/CjvWNMRndvM/s640/Screenshot1.png" height="499" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The new version of the first good screenshot.&lt;br /&gt;Showing off the player, health item, level 1 enemies and spawners, and the level tileset.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--VcwuHPin34/UUpnNsnIcBI/AAAAAAAAAZM/MvwxqDN6Q4Q/s1600/Screenshot2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--VcwuHPin34/UUpnNsnIcBI/AAAAAAAAAZM/MvwxqDN6Q4Q/s640/Screenshot2.png" height="500" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The new key, locked door, and level progression ladder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lUrdZ3RITxs/UUpnNhKB9rI/AAAAAAAAAZU/gVZXyxd2KTw/s1600/Screenshot3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lUrdZ3RITxs/UUpnNhKB9rI/AAAAAAAAAZU/gVZXyxd2KTw/s640/Screenshot3.png" height="500" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The tileset for Level 2, level 2 enemies and spawners, and a new health pickup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jlPpROQHjPU/UUpnOM9EVlI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/ZL3x2mmxAXE/s1600/Screenshot4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jlPpROQHjPU/UUpnOM9EVlI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/ZL3x2mmxAXE/s640/Screenshot4.png" height="500" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The enemies for Levels 1-4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It's...beautiful.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5063056279039870642/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/art.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5063056279039870642'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5063056279039870642'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/art.html' title='ART!!!!!'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CdEH86-3w8Y/UUpnNg5RfaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/CjvWNMRndvM/s72-c/Screenshot1.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-3174481730286966392</id><published>2013-03-18T20:37:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:47:44.840-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Some Hurdles</title><content type='html'>Wow, two posts in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to talk about some of the hurdles I've faced with this toolset and working on Crypt Crawler. I'm using &lt;a href="http://love2d.org/"&gt;Love2D&lt;/a&gt; for this month's game, along with the Bump (collision detection), MiddleClass (object orientation), and AnAL (animation) libraries to help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first hurdle I had was part of the collision library. This is the first time I've built a game without rolling my own collision detection and management. Normally, I can just insert collision detection right into my movement code. This time, all the entities' positions are updated, &lt;b&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; the collisions are detected and resolved. When the collisions are detected in Bump, you're given a collision vector, which is the distance you could move one object or the other so the collision was no longer happening. The problem I had was that the vector was either horizontal or vertical. Bump isn't smart enough to take the object's previous position into account when calculating this vector. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, except my world is built out of square tiles. So, when the character tries to move along the wall, there will be a lot of places where you collide with two blocks, one would generate a horizontal collision vector, and one would generate a vertical vector. Applying them both to the player would cause them to get "stuck" against the wall. I needed the player to be able to grind along the wall. So I split my code so that, when a player collides with solid objects, the other objects are put into an array. After all the movement is done, all the solid collisions are resolved. This gave me the effect I wanted, and I will probably use it if I have to use an external collision management library again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second hurdle (which I'm still struggling with) is the limitations of the Love2D ParticleSystem class. All the effects in Crypt Crawler are "burst" based. This means that I needed the particle system to create a whole bunch of particles in one frame, update them according to their parameters, and not emit any more until the effect happens again somewhere else. The Love2D ParticleSystem doesn't seem to support this. It only supports continuously emitting particles. Now, I can set it up so it only emits particles for a short time, but that limits the effects I can do, and I can't actually limit it to emitting for just one frame. I have to set the total limit on particles for the system very low, set the number of particles emitted per second very high, and set the amount of time the particle system is active to be extremely short. &lt;b&gt;Then&lt;/b&gt; I get somewhat of a burst effect, but it would be much nicer to just have a BurstParticle() function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final hurdle, and I feel like a bit of a sellout complaining about this, but man, do I miss Intellisense and Debugging. It's been a while since I've had to work without a good IDE and debugger tools. Lua is an okay language, but the lack of a dedicated IDE is lowering my opinion of it. Then again, that is my entire goal with this endeavor. I've spent the past couple years amassing these...toolsets for game making, and they were just sitting on my hard drive gathering (figurative) dust. This is my chance to go through and actually try them out. Inevitably, there would be some that I don't like as much. I've kept Love2D around because it fits on my thumb drive, so I can develop anywhere I can find a computer. This experience will finally let me say I tried it and remove the urge to just use this toolset for the sake of using it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3174481730286966392/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/some-hurdles.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3174481730286966392'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3174481730286966392'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/some-hurdles.html' title='Some Hurdles'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1529044057061085472</id><published>2013-03-18T20:06:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:47:52.571-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>1GAM March - Crypt Crawler Progress</title><content type='html'>So...the game's pretty much done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Well, not really. MY part is as done as I had set out in the beginning of this month. I have 5 fully functional levels, 5 types of enemies, health items, keys and locked doors, decent effects...wow. I didn't think I would be anywhere near this far at this point in the month. Here are some screenshots of the game as it stands now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c59Nl-ZttvI/UUekChqJyyI/AAAAAAAAAYo/OJWIES30k1U/s1600/Screenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c59Nl-ZttvI/UUekChqJyyI/AAAAAAAAAYo/OJWIES30k1U/s640/Screenshot1.png" height="499" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A basic section of the first level.

Of course, you can't see in the picture, but the crossbones are moving up and fading away slowly.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;So, mechanically, the game is pretty much complete. Unfortunately, it is completely full of programmer art. I tried my hand at drawing the enemy spawning sprites (as you saw in the last post) and animating some effects. But it just doesn't look that good. So, I've brought in an artist. It's interesting integrating someone else into my workflow, especially when I have so little left to do in terms of major features. It feels a little weird pushing "all" the remaining work onto the artist. I almost don't want to add any more features for fear of just loading more work onto someone else and pushing past the deadline. We threw around the idea of a boss level, but I'm hesitant to put that much work into a feature I didn't plan from the outset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of that, I am extremely excited about this. This is shaping up to be my best game yet (especially since this is just a clone of an older game).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1529044057061085472/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/1gam-march-crypt-crawler-progress.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1529044057061085472'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1529044057061085472'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/1gam-march-crypt-crawler-progress.html' title='1GAM March - Crypt Crawler Progress'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c59Nl-ZttvI/UUekChqJyyI/AAAAAAAAAYo/OJWIES30k1U/s72-c/Screenshot1.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8320571495538343909</id><published>2013-03-09T20:35:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:47:59.072-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>1GAM March - Rogue</title><content type='html'>Hooray! New project!! After the past two months participating in &lt;a href="http://onegameamonth.com/"&gt;OneGameAMonth&lt;/a&gt;, I'm riding high. Well, I wasn't really. The ideas for January and February came so easily. First there was Global Game Jam, which just naturally gets the creative juices flowing, then I just took the idea I originally had for Global Game Jam and worked on that for February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then...I was back at square 1, without an original idea to carry me through March. So, I cheated. Normally, when I'm faced with a length of time that I want to spend honing my game development skills and I don't have an idea for a project, I'll clone classic Atari games from when I was a kid. I've already done the big ones: Pong, Space Invaders, Breakout, Pac-man, and Mastermind. Then I did one that &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; liked: Haunted House (which was recently remade and is now available on Steam, I might add). So I went back through my catalog of old Atari games to see if anything stuck out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, McFunkyPants announced the theme for this month: Rogue. While it is an extremely broad concept, I immediately thought of &lt;a href="http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=682" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Dark Chambers&lt;/a&gt; for the Atari 7800. Dark Chambers is an early version of Gauntlet. I traced back its history a little and found that the maker of Dark Chambers built an earlier version that later inspired the makers of the original Gauntlet, effectively making Dark Chambers for the 7800 Gauntlet's less famous little brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to remake Dark Chambers and started on this month's project:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0ADv7iRr-sE/UTvYAs0e5BI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/uJnADYf7AG0/s1600/TitleScreen.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0ADv7iRr-sE/UTvYAs0e5BI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/uJnADYf7AG0/s400/TitleScreen.png" height="480" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;My extremely basic Title Screen placeholder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I'm using &lt;a href="http://love2d.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Love2D&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for this one. I'm not all that happy with it. Maybe it's because I have more experience with more complex object-oriented languages. Lua's table structure makes it a little difficult to get much done. Plus, I'm using a normal text editor to write it instead of an IDE, and I'm really missing the code completion. Oh well. At least I'll be able to say that I tried it and managed to finish a game with it. The facts that I will be able to publish to multiple platforms pretty easily and that the entire library is extremely tiny may make me swing back to it for a future project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually am putting a decent amount of time into the art for this one. I found this video series on youtube of this guy recording time lapses of himself remastering screens from classic video games. Here's his entry from Contra:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya1KqQSkXAA" target="_blank"&gt;Contra - Energy Zone Boss Remastered&lt;/a&gt;. It inspired me to try to learn my toolset a little better. This is what I ended up with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a7DZgdrvHt0/UTvinNQ6WiI/AAAAAAAAAXY/MVp396cRqXk/s1600/Screenshot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a7DZgdrvHt0/UTvinNQ6WiI/AAAAAAAAAXY/MVp396cRqXk/s1600/Screenshot.png" height="499" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I've only really done the enemy spawners (the row starting with the gravestone). But I'm really proud of that bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've gotten to the point where my Done board is filled with more stuff than my To Do board. I keep telling myself to hurry and finish because "March is almost over." Then I look at a calendar, and March isn't almost over at all.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8320571495538343909/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/1gam-march-rogue.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8320571495538343909'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8320571495538343909'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/03/1gam-march-rogue.html' title='1GAM March - Rogue'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0ADv7iRr-sE/UTvYAs0e5BI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/uJnADYf7AG0/s72-c/TitleScreen.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5700449568180876094</id><published>2013-02-26T08:25:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2013-03-26T17:18:49.217-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Benefits of Feedback</title><content type='html'>It seems silly now. Really, I can't believe I didn't take advantage of this sooner. The Internet is an amazing device. It's ability to deliver instant feedback from anywhere in the world is unparalleled. One just has to get over the fear that the feedback may be terrible. There may be people out there who hate what you've created. Worse, there may be people who don't have any strong feelings about what you've created, but say terrible things just to be trolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I'm talking about this is that it's something I just recently discovered the benefit of myself. Soon after finishing up my 1GAM entry for February, Smoke Rush, I posted a link to the project page to every social network I'm a member of. Overnight, I got good feedback, including some ideas for new features I hadn't thought of. Things like having the canisters you pick up drain over time, having the number of points you get depend on how full the canister is when you pick it up, having more than one canister on the screen at a time, and powerups. I immediately saw the benefits to all of these. They all increased player engagement. I just HAD to implement them asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 3 were easy enough to sketch out in my head and I was able to implement them pretty well within a half hour. The powerups were another story. They would take more time than I had left to work on this project. I had already decided to take this week and learn Lua/Love2D for use in next month's project. Between that and a full-time job...I wish I had more time to spend on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson here is: get feedback. Get it often and get it early. Get it as soon as you have something that can be considered a game. Get it from everywhere.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5700449568180876094/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/benefits-of-feedback.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5700449568180876094'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5700449568180876094'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/benefits-of-feedback.html' title='Benefits of Feedback'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1703483049830865269</id><published>2013-02-23T23:24:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:48:05.626-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Smoke Rush - Post Mortem</title><content type='html'>My second 1GAM game is finalized and uploaded to project hosting. You can get to the project hosting page &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/02-february-1gam-constriction/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or through the Projects link at the top of this blog. Considering that there were 1120 submissions for January and there are only 153 for February (at time of writing. It's only the 23rd), I'm very pleased that I managed to stick with this for another month. I haven't been thinking "I have to make the best games ever!" I've just been thinking "I have to make a lot of games this year." Maybe that's led me to be a little accepting of bad quality in my games, but I feel better knowing that I can call them "finished." Already, I've tripled the number of completed projects I have here. That's incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned a lot during this project. It was the first XNA project I've completed, the first time I used someone else's library (&lt;a href="http://www.xnaparticles.com/"&gt;DPSF&lt;/a&gt;), and the first time I publicized my game on more than one social network. The game just went live about 45 minutes ago, so I'm not sure how that last one will turn out, but I'll talk about the first 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the limitations I faced getting this to run on other people's computers, this will probably be the last time I use XNA on a project. It's meant to build games for the XBox, where you don't have the issue of dependencies. XNA relies on having .NET Framework and XNA Framework installed. And although it comes with a handy one-click publisher that creates an installer that will automatically go out and install those two, my experience says users do not like to install things. Especially if they don't know what they're for. I strove to make my previous games as stand-alone as possible, and I don't like that XNA depends on things that not everyone has. I'm sad to say this about XNA, especially since C# has become the language I'm most comfortable with and the one I use at my day job, but unless I get really good user feedback about the install process, I'm taking XNA out of my toolbelt. It's not like I don't have other options. I have a sizable collection of other game making software I can use. Maybe I'll pick up HTML5 as a development platform. There are a whole bunch of libraries being written for it and Javascript is second to C# in languages I use at my day job. Or maybe I'll switch to Lua/Love2D. It has distributions for other platforms and has a stable (if small) community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn't help that XNA has been abandoned by Microsoft. Although I hear that MonoGame is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, XNA was a dream to develop with. The documentation is really in-depth and I didn't run in to any weird bugs. In my own code, anyway. Trying to get DPSF to run the way I wanted was a little trying at times. I may have implemented things wrong, but it seems a little weird that you have to build a new ParticleSystem class for each effect you want. One really annoying thing is that there doesn't seem to be a way to define the speed of particles separately from the direction. Each particle only has a Velocity and you can only define one Min and one Max velocity. This means that, if your emitters are configured to release particles in all directions, you won't get a circle shape, you'll get a square. That made it extremely difficult to get the explosion effects I wanted. Other than that, it was an okay library to use, but I don't think I'll be using it in the future either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I'm just glad I was able to crank this project out in a month. It gives me hope for the rest of the year. At least for myself. The 1GAM event will probably do just fine for the whole year, but I predict that the community will experience a lot of turnover and drop off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just have to come up with an idea for next month...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1703483049830865269/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/smoke-rush-post-mortem.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1703483049830865269'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1703483049830865269'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/smoke-rush-post-mortem.html' title='Smoke Rush - Post Mortem'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-3959833972213639167</id><published>2013-02-19T23:11:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:48:12.805-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>New Name &amp; Game Screens</title><content type='html'>Given the way the particle system affected the general flavor of the game, I decided it needed a name change. After much deliberation (read, about 10 minutes), I decided on "Smoke Rush." Of course, this meant that I had to track down everywhere within the project that the word "Constriction" would be exposed to the player and change it without breaking anything. The actual project files will probably still say "Constriction" but it was only a working title anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, I have new screenshots. It's looking like I'll be using the same flow I used for Inkscape: Title Screen -&amp;gt; Controls -&amp;gt; Play -&amp;gt; Game Over -&amp;gt; Title Screen. It seems to work well, it's quick and easy, it tells the player what they need to know, and it doesn't take up too much of the player's time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-atovfAH40_Y/USRLFsfLXWI/AAAAAAAAAVc/ezLfDffSoAc/s1600/Screenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-atovfAH40_Y/USRLFsfLXWI/AAAAAAAAAVc/ezLfDffSoAc/s640/Screenshot1.png" height="480" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Title Screen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tKBnky_RbdQ/USRLF7q5h2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/5h_TQwC8Xk0/s1600/Screenshot2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tKBnky_RbdQ/USRLF7q5h2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/5h_TQwC8Xk0/s640/Screenshot2.png" height="480" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Help Screen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4dNWfI4fXWE/USRLF10hw9I/AAAAAAAAAVY/o1S3M02DROw/s1600/Screenshot3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4dNWfI4fXWE/USRLF10hw9I/AAAAAAAAAVY/o1S3M02DROw/s640/Screenshot3.png" height="480" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Game Over Screen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Pretty much all I have left are effects and some balance tweaking. I'm going to refactor the way the game handles its state. Currently, game state is just a variable in the MainGame class and the Update and Draw functions have big switch statements in them. I'm going to break out an IGameState class that each state will inherit from. This should make it easier to have more complex effects on each screen and a splash screen or two. I have an entire Trello task for "Add Juice to Title Screen." I'm thinking something like having a big smoke-ball shoot over the screen that the title will appear behind, or maybe have the smokey darkness constrict on the screen, then pull away to reveal the title. I'm not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very last thing I want to try is converting the player to use mouse control instead of keyboard control. That will probably make the game too easy, but it will make the game more accessible to my playtesters, most of whom are not hard-core PC gamers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3959833972213639167/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/new-name-game-screens.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3959833972213639167'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3959833972213639167'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/new-name-game-screens.html' title='New Name &amp; Game Screens'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-atovfAH40_Y/USRLFsfLXWI/AAAAAAAAAVc/ezLfDffSoAc/s72-c/Screenshot1.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5276838182654478377</id><published>2013-02-16T10:58:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:48:22.069-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>The Wondrous Particle System</title><content type='html'>I've never worked with Particle Systems before (outside of GameMaker 7.0). I understood the theory, probably well enough to build my own, but I wanted to see what else was out there before resorting to that. Mostly to see how much time I could save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cydn_b8ONy8/URmerXIRwwI/AAAAAAAAALY/iQGvUSa0jvU/s1600/DPSFLogo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cydn_b8ONy8/URmerXIRwwI/AAAAAAAAALY/iQGvUSa0jvU/s320/DPSFLogo.png" height="160" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.xnaparticles.com/"&gt;DPSF&lt;/a&gt;, the Dynamic Particle System Framework for XNA. It was the first one I sat down and tried out, and I was able to get the basic effect I wanted after only 30 minutes of tinkering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than give you a library that exposes all the functionality you'd need to customize your particle system, DPSF recommends that you copy one of their ParticleSystemTemplates into your project and alter it as you see fit. It's a unique approach (as far as I know) that carries a rather steep learning curve. I had to spend almost an entire day reading through the documentation before I knew enough to start playing around. Although, that could be because of the crippling head cold I've been fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s7-weuWHnuk/URmgD_s0X3I/AAAAAAAAALk/bCXwb72ATwU/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s7-weuWHnuk/URmgD_s0X3I/AAAAAAAAALk/bCXwb72ATwU/s400/Untitled.png" height="312" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here's what the result of my tinkering looks like. It's a far cry from the trash-compactor it used to be. You can't see it here, since I turned off the part that draws the constricting walls, but I switched out the extending Rectangle objects for simple square Rectangle objects that moving in and out. With the way the fog ended up looking and the way my collision system is shaping up, this method makes more sense from the player's perspective. I found myself believing that the only danger was at the head of the fog trail, when I knew the threatening Rectangle extended all the way back to the edge of the screen. So, I changed the game so that was true. We'll see how that holds up in playtesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up is damage. I have two basic decisions to make regarding the behavior of damage. Does being damaged change the player's position? Meaning, is there a knock-back effect? And is the player only damaged when they are caught between the constricting blocks or are they damaged whenever they touch a constricting block. Having knock-back will have very unpredictable results. Players could get caught in an infinite combo until they lose. For the second, since the constricting walls are starting to look like fireballs, I'll probably go with "damage whenever contact is made."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note, I'm trying out a new productivity tool that a coworker introduced me to called &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;. I gotta say, committing my code to version control at the end of a hard coding session was a decent reward, but to actually see your progress, to be able to list out everything that you've accomplished, is invaluable. Plus, it allows me to record a complete list of all the features I want to put in the game and see how much is left at any time. It has richer features than I'm using, such as assigning a task to an individual, commenting on and discussing a task, and attaching things to tasks. But I think it's still worth it, even as a sole game developer.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5276838182654478377/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-wondrous-particle-system.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5276838182654478377'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5276838182654478377'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-wondrous-particle-system.html' title='The Wondrous Particle System'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cydn_b8ONy8/URmerXIRwwI/AAAAAAAAALY/iQGvUSa0jvU/s72-c/DPSFLogo.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-9210701553859944038</id><published>2013-02-15T13:00:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:55:12.842-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Switching Methods</title><content type='html'>I'm having a really hard time getting the existing constriction engine to work like the image I have in my head. Difficulty is getting harder to define too. I honestly don't know how to take this all-screen-constriction and make it challenging at the start, but still get more difficult over time. Therefore, I'm switching back to my original *original* idea of just having the left and right walls constrict on the player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may rename the game to something like "Trash Compactor," but the feel and tension will be the same. Not to mention that collision detection and increasing difficulty will be a whole lot easier with this idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9zY7gUXzJlc/URfH6s-rjuI/AAAAAAAAALI/weKTgQA087I/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="312" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9zY7gUXzJlc/URfH6s-rjuI/AAAAAAAAALI/weKTgQA087I/s400/Untitled.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm still going to go with a particle idea to give the constricting walls more of a "foggy" look. I may hide the wall-rectangles entirely and see what kind of effect that gives. Here's a screenshot of what the new constriction looks like. Obviously, the color will be changed soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may still try and implement an effect to give the constriction a more liquid look. That will probably involve looking up water physics engines, which is a little more complicated than I wanted this game to be. But considering that all I have left are the title and game over screens, the difficulty curve, and the particle system, I'm set up to have some time left before the month is over. I can look in to the water idea or spend some time "juicing" up the game. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/9210701553859944038/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/switching-methods.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9210701553859944038'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9210701553859944038'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/switching-methods.html' title='Switching Methods'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9zY7gUXzJlc/URfH6s-rjuI/AAAAAAAAALI/weKTgQA087I/s72-c/Untitled.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8042725063173555621</id><published>2013-02-14T14:14:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:55:12.831-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>1GAM February - Constriction</title><content type='html'>This is a personal record for me. I've only been working on my February 1GAM entry for 2 days, and it already has me excited enough to blog about it. While we were in the brainstorming session of GGJ last month, I came up with an idea for a game I called "Constriction." I was a little disappointed when the idea didn't get picked up by anyone else, so I made it into my 1GAM February entry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constriction is a 2D Endless Single Screen Arcade game in the same vein as the original Snake. You know, the game where you move around the screen, eating stuff that makes your tail grow longer, until you end up trapped and have to eat yourself to move anywhere. The pieces are the same in my game, but instead of you getting bigger, the walls pulsate and constrict around you. They do this continuously, and picking up the stuff makes them faster and more random. I'm debating about whether colliding with the walls kills you immediately or hurts you over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b id="internal-source-marker_0.8106104643084109" style="clear: left; float: left; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img height="200" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lxjpqAz5mkwaTCzGwxwH9ZuhZIg9aBeCtA46CL_VbrTs7k8fKNbSO1jM1ojilVfRY7YcT71u4JTO8Z4PJiH3E8i2KhvlFt8XyMwPDqtJqc5rSs5kLElPQnxXdw" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;But anyway, on to the progress report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my original concept sketch. Just enough to illustrate the idea I wanted it to look like. The blue circle is the player and the red box is the thing the player has to collect. I've been calling them "treats" for now, even though that makes the player sound like a mouse or something. The player movement, picking up items, and basic scorekeeping were things I had done dozens of times before. The hard part is going to be the pulsating walls. They are what makes the game after all. I'll worry about doing something to ramp up their difficulty later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lgFc1QmDR9Q/UQ3SkiB0iPI/AAAAAAAAAKY/rQW4TJhMYNY/s1600/Screenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lgFc1QmDR9Q/UQ3SkiB0iPI/AAAAAAAAAKY/rQW4TJhMYNY/s320/Screenshot1.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Step 1: Nail down the basic player movement, goal behavior, and score keeping. pretty basic stuff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fca45A5fgoM/UQ3SkilVV3I/AAAAAAAAAKc/ft1PvZPdCOM/s1600/Screenshot3.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fca45A5fgoM/UQ3SkilVV3I/AAAAAAAAAKc/ft1PvZPdCOM/s320/Screenshot3.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Step 2: It looked like the best option was to have a list of Verticies that would make up the inner wall of the constriction. I successfully implemented an algorithm that made the verticies approach a certain target point on the screen and arrive there at the same time. This meant that some verticies moved faster than others, but it gives the effect I want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pHm_KaPMpZI/UQ3SlBTXWAI/AAAAAAAAAKo/MeUJIgKFK5s/s1600/Screenshot4.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pHm_KaPMpZI/UQ3SlBTXWAI/AAAAAAAAAKo/MeUJIgKFK5s/s320/Screenshot4.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Step 3: Now we get to the hard stuff. I didn't know anything about how XNA handled drawing primitive shapes. When I was building stuff in Java, practically everything was made up of shapes drawn with the Graphics2D class. XNA seemed to only deal in sprites as far as my knowledge went. I did a little extra digging and found the GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitives() method. Which takes a list of vertices and draws an arbitrary shape from them. Here they are drawing a simple line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cGdNx89a7tk/UQ3SlOfeGUI/AAAAAAAAAKs/pLOLGYh34Yc/s1600/Screenshot5.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cGdNx89a7tk/UQ3SlOfeGUI/AAAAAAAAAKs/pLOLGYh34Yc/s320/Screenshot5.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Final Step (for now): DrawUserPrimitives() worked fine for outlining, but I needed a way to fill in the outside of the arbitrary shape that I had constructed. I explored lengthy tutorials on VertexBuffers and IndexBuffers, until I found that DrawUserPrimitives has an argument that tells it to fill the shape. Technically, what it does is take a list of verticies that form interconnected triangles, and fills those in. I played around with the order of the verticies and their original positions along the wall until I had them in a sequence that formed interconnected triangles. After about 3 hours of messing around, I had the constricting walls you see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending nearly all day just getting this feature to work, I had to celebrate a little. I didn't actually think this would work and I had started to lose faith in XNA. But, I wanted to build at least one game in it before abandoning it for something that hasn't been left behind by its creators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a lot to work on. Next will be to make the walls pulsate more randomly. Right now, the walls constrict down to a perfect circle and then retract. They should have peaks and valleys, reaching towards their target and threatening the player. It should be easy enough to just add some wiggling to the verticies, but it's getting late right now. After that, I want to try out a simple particle system to give the walls a more smokey look to them. Adding wiggling to the verticies will probably look too straight and jagged, so I'm hoping a fog effect will mitigate that somewhat. I have to make the constricting walls damage the player. Lastly, and most difficult after just getting the walls to constrict like this, is difficulty. I have some ideas on how to make the game progressively harder, but I don't know if they'll actually work. We'll find out later this month!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8042725063173555621/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/1gam-february-constriction.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8042725063173555621'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8042725063173555621'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/02/1gam-february-constriction.html' title='1GAM February - Constriction'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lxjpqAz5mkwaTCzGwxwH9ZuhZIg9aBeCtA46CL_VbrTs7k8fKNbSO1jM1ojilVfRY7YcT71u4JTO8Z4PJiH3E8i2KhvlFt8XyMwPDqtJqc5rSs5kLElPQnxXdw=s72-c' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5319457855639799492</id><published>2013-01-27T15:44:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:48:37.878-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GGJ 2013'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>GGJ2013 - Final Day.

Starting to feel the Drag</title><content type='html'>Day 2 of Global Game Jam 2013. I have lost faith that I will survive this ordeal. I believe the short one has gone insane and will kill us all when we inevitably fall asleep at our keyboards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...yeah, that's totally not how it went. As expected, today was full of what I can only describe as grinding. An entire day of the worst parts of game development. Arguing about features, trying to avoid scope creep, learning to be satisfied that some bugs can't be fixed in the time allowed, and being proud that something resembling a game is starting to appear out of this mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident enough in this project to submit it to 1GAM for January. It's a landmark in my game development "career" and it's something I will never forget. I will probably be back next year, and I hope there will be more participants. Looking around the room now, there's only one other seasoned programmer left. The rest are either artists or designers. Then again, this is only the second year this place has been a GGJ site, so word is still getting around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to how today actually went. I was the third participant to arrive this morning and the first of my team. I pulled down the game and started working on what I could. I took a break to check up on other teams' progress my designer arrived. He sat down and started poking at the code, so I fired up &lt;a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html"&gt;SFXR&lt;/a&gt; and started filling in our sound library. The tool is a god-send. I'd put it right up there with GameMaker or Unity as a "standard" tool for game jams. Within about an hour, I had a library of around 25 sound effects that we could use in our game. We only ended up using about 6 or so, but the effect was immediate and awesome. As I took another look around at the other teams over the course of the day, I was happy to see the tool being used by others to great effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the rest of the day was spent alternating people actually working on the game. Our team has various levels of experience with art and programming, so our codebase and art library make an...interesting mix. I tried to stay as far away from the art as I could, but I still ended up contributing a little in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the feeling some members of our team don't have a very good idea on how to judge deadlines. Most of our remaining brainstorming sessions were me trying to tone down their expectations of what would be included in the final product (mostly because it would fall to me to actually implement them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it's not over yet, but I think we've made about as much progress as we can on this game. The rest of the weekend will probably be spent on final tweaks and the title screen. There are a couple of medium sized bugs, but I can't fix them without rewriting large chunks of the game (stupid moving props).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's that. Day 2 in a nutshell. Look forward to the game showing up under the Project sidebar tomorrow night.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4308089445071165687/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/ggj2013-day-two-starting-to-feel-drag.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4308089445071165687'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4308089445071165687'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/ggj2013-day-two-starting-to-feel-drag.html' title='GGJ2013 - Day Two.

Having your cherry popped</title><content type='html'>I just got home from Day 1 of my first ever Game Jam!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh man, what an experience. As I've complained about before, practically none of my friends are in to actually making games. We've tried to get together to work on something a couple of times, but the planning always fell through early on. This is the first time I'm actually working seriously with other people on a project.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here's the blow-by-blow of Day 1 for anyone who doesn't know how these things are typically run:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I found the building and room just fine. I walked in to find a group of people already set up and enjoying a game of Magic: The Gathering. I sat and watched and chatted a little about the older editions that I used to collect. Then the organizer and the rest of the participants arrived. All told, there were about 12 jammers there tonight. We took our seats (not that we'd be staying in them very long) as the organizer warmed up the projector. We watched the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://globalgamejam.org/news/2013/01/26/ggj13-keynote-brett-victor-and-erin-robinson"&gt;Keynote Video&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and then we were given the Theme. I'll hold off on mentioning the Theme until tomorrow, as I think there are still some sites in Asia or Western Europe that haven't started yet. We had a typical sort of ice breaker. You know. Go around the room. What's your name? What's your expertise? What do you hope to get out of this weekend? The usual stuff. I was surprised at how few of the participants were programmers. I only counted 5-6 including myself. I thought the ratio would be more like 80% programmers, not 50%. 4 of the remaining 6 were artists, and the other 2 were designers/people who were curious about what a Game Jam was. My site is on a college campus, so I imagine advertising to students outside the target audience was bound to happen. Then the brainstorming began.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We all went to a separate corner of the whiteboards and just wrote stuff. I spent some time installing my planned development tools, predicting that I probably wouldn't need them if a fellow programmer had a better tool they wanted to use. I jotted a quick idea on my section of the board, then I noticed something I wasn't expecting. Someone walked over to someone else's board and they started brainstorming together. I never imagined finding people here who were actually social. So, I decided to try it. I looked at the ideas of the guy next to me, and offered my opinion on which of his ideas I fount most interesting. And we just shot off from there. I think I bounced ideas off everyone in the room at some point. It was amazing!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After that, we each kinda picked an idea we liked (in most cases, someone else's), and set out to make it a reality. The tool of choice seemed to be GameMaker 8. I have some experience with GameMaker 7, but my license expired and I missed the renewal period. I had forgotten how quickly you can build things with GameMaker. Prototypes that would have taken me hours were taking shape in mere minutes. I couldn't believe it. Why did I ever let this tool go? Fortunately, I hadn't forgotten as much as I thought and I still managed to be useful to my team.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some of the jammers started to turn in for the night, I got to talking to the organizer (a professor at the university) about his&amp;nbsp;curriculum. Turns out he had just started reading through the documentation and some tutorials for Unity3D, which I had spent this entire month learning. I gave him some advice on gotchas with the interface and folder structure, showed him how to change his external script editor when MonoDevelop wouldn't work, and pointed out the more advanced debugging features.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All in all, this was an amazing first day. Now we'll see if this excitement keeps up after tomorrow.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4163514293328253994/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/ggj2013-day-one-having-your-cherry.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4163514293328253994'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4163514293328253994'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/ggj2013-day-one-having-your-cherry.html' title='GGJ2013 - Day One.

You know how I've been saying for a long time that I only have one finished game under my belt? That's not entirely true. I actually have more than 20 "finished" games under my belt. Now, I should mention that at least 12 of these games are practically direct copies of classic games. I, like most other aspiring game developers, cloned Minesweeper, Tetris, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, to name a few. The other 10 or so games are original ideas. Well, they're original in that I came up with them without outside inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this means for you, my reader, is that I am working on a page for this blog that will have links to all my projects, screenshots, and a little synopsis for each game. This will be a bit of an undertaking, as these games have been built for in-browser play and I'm not sure Blogger would appreciate it if I tried hosting them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, well, whatever. We'll see what the new Projects page actually looks like when it's finished someday.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8345468249692764477/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-pages.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8345468249692764477'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8345468249692764477'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-pages.html' title='New Pages'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8103362678286872799</id><published>2013-01-17T16:21:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:48:45.078-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='GGJ 2013'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>GGJ 2013 Expectations</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sites/default/files/ggjlogo1dates.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://globalgamejam.org/sites/default/files/ggjlogo1dates.png" height="108" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://globalgamejam.org/"&gt;Global Game Jam 2013&lt;/a&gt; starts next Friday, and yours truly will be participating!! Woohoo!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be my first game jam ever. Take a moment and let that sink in... I've heard that this is pretty much the place to be if you are at all serious about building games. So I'll go see if it lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/image/index_n55.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://thelettervsixtim.es/image/index_n55.png" height="186" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This will be the second time I've worked with another person on a game. I had an artist work with me on a puzzle-platformer with gravity manipulation when I was in college. We built it in GameMaker 7.0, and it was...playable. Of course I was blown away when I played &lt;a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/"&gt;VVVVVV&lt;/a&gt; a few years later, but I was still proud of my effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What am I expecting to happen at GGJ2013? &lt;/b&gt;Definitely to feel like crap on Sunday. I'm no stranger to weekend-long events full of new information and awesome people, and needing a few days to recover seems par the course when it comes to these. There are 8 jammers (including me) signed up for the site I'll be going to. Of those 8, I think only one has listed talent in graphics. I'm predicting some ugly games with lots of programmer art. 8 seems like too big a team for a 48-hour project, so we'll probably be split up into teams of 4. The coordinator warned me that site-provided computers were limited, so I'll be lugging my giant tower desktop with me, just in case. It may happen that more than 8 people show up to jam. My site is at a college, after all. I have a few simple game ideas in mind, but I'm not going to be too hopeful. My talent is not in game design or idea generation. It's in implementation. I'm pretty good at letting other people do work, at giving up control over some pieces of my project. I'm also pretty good at matching other people's coding styles, so as long as the people I end up with aren't control freaks or assholes, I think I should be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www-math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/clock.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www-math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/clock.gif" height="200" width="190" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;What will be the hardest part of GGJ2013? &lt;/b&gt;I think the hardest part will probably be the length. I've never worked on a game for more than a couple hours at a time, and even that's rare. 48 hours is a long time to sit in front of a computer. I have no idea how the breaks are structured,&amp;nbsp; or if the word "structure" even applies to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do I most want to get out of GGJ2013?&lt;/b&gt; Number 1 would be networking. Outside of work, I know zero serious programmers. I know one person who's built an almost-playable game in RPG Maker. I'm hoping not only to meet with other programmers, but to be mentored by them as well. It's true that I learned programming in school, but everything I've learned about the art of game development, I learned on my own. I'm definitely looking forward to either having my techniques validated, or be shown a better way of doing things. Number 2 would be experience. I only have one "finished" game under my belt so far. That has to change. I don't expect to finish a game, but being "forced" to work on one might be just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm debating whether to blog while I'm there. It will definitely be worth it after the fact when I want to relive the memory, but I don't know whether I'll have the brainpower to spare. I'll definitely write a post-mortem though, and post the game here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish me luck!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8103362678286872799/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/ggj-2013-expectations.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8103362678286872799'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8103362678286872799'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/ggj-2013-expectations.html' title='GGJ 2013 Expectations'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-2465200762585287851</id><published>2013-01-13T10:41:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2013-01-15T22:29:23.980-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Methods of Learning</title><content type='html'>So I've taken the plunge and started learning&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://unity3d.com/"&gt;Unity3D&lt;/a&gt;. The program has become the be-all-end-all of 3D game builders. As a starting point, I got a copy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unity-Development-Example-Beginners-Guide/dp/1849690545/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1358090179&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=unity+game+development+by+example"&gt;Unity Development By Example&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for Christmas to get me started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The book is good. It does a decent job of explaining things as it goes, if you manage to read through all of it, that is. I just couldn't follow it. It was...boring. And confusing, considering that chapters 1 and 2 start you on a project and get it 1/3 finished, the book jumps to another project for chapter 3, chapters 4 and 5 jump back to the first project, chapter 6 jumps back to the project from chapter 3, chapters 7 and 8 start a new project, and chapters 9 and 10 finish the project from chapters 1-2/4-5. Those aren't the exact chapter-to-project mapping, but you get the idea. This isn't my first "development by example" book. The other one got me started on XNA, so I know they're normally good for something. But this one just didn't do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was about to dive into another Unity book, when I decided to try out a video tutorial instead. My first stop was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cookingwithunity.com/"&gt;Cooking with Unity&lt;/a&gt;, which I consider a household name when it comes to learning Unity. I was a little disappointed when I learned that their early videos used an older version of Unity. Plus, each video is an hour+. So I kept looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.burgzergarcade.com/sites/burgzergarcade.com/files/pixture_reloaded_logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www.burgzergarcade.com/sites/burgzergarcade.com/files/pixture_reloaded_logo.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I struck gold with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYqzz1dy3Ak&amp;amp;list=SPE5C2870574BF4B06"&gt;BergZergArcade&lt;/a&gt;. The videos are short (really short), so I can sit down for a session without worrying about not having an hour to spare the entire thing. The other upside, and I assume this is true for all video tutorials, is that the code is written and run right in front of you. More than once, while reading through Game Development By Example, I found that I had missed a line of code or, even worse, the code in the book had the error. At one point, I spent hours trying to figure out why the book-provided model was facing the wrong way during gameplay. It turned out I had to mess with the model import settings, something the book neglected to mention I could do, in order to correct the issue. During the videos, however, any errors I notice are also experienced by the narrator and corrected very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm definitely learning a lot more through the video tutorials method than I was with the book method. We'll see if I learn enough in time for GGJ this month.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2465200762585287851/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/methods-of-learning.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2465200762585287851'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2465200762585287851'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2013/01/methods-of-learning.html' title='Methods of Learning'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-402789858568258690</id><published>2012-12-25T20:49:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2013-02-19T23:14:07.183-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1GAM'/><title type='text'>Keeping Motivated: One Game A Month</title><content type='html'>Some time last year, several people I know participated in something called NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month). Authors sign up and pledge to write around 20,000 words every day for the entire month. There's progress tracking to keep everyone honest and it was a great motivator for all the participants I knew. It made me very jealous, since I didn't think there was anything equivalent for game developers. My Google-Fu did not fail me, and I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/"&gt;1GAM (One Game A Month)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will be participating in 1GAM. With only one "complete" game under my belt, I'm not sure how well I will do. It's not a competition or anything. There are achievements, but those are primarily for personal motivation. It's all handled through Twitter and is managed by @McFunkypants. You can follow the event at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OneGameAMonth"&gt;@OneGameAMonth&lt;/a&gt; or by searching for #onegameamonth on Twitter. My handle is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FireSpinnerJoe"&gt;@FireSpinnerJoe&lt;/a&gt;, but I will probably be posting stuff here too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends who did NaNoWriMo (who were successful) all suggested planning ahead of the actual mad dash during the month. So I have a Google Doc document to keep track of my basic ideas for each month. I won't put too much stock in it, since forming teams is encouraged and other people might have their own ideas. I have an okay idea of how the first couple months are going to go. Unless something else turns up, I'll be using XNA for 2D games and Unity3D for 3D games. I will be participating in &lt;a href="http://globalgamejam.org/"&gt;Global Game Jam&lt;/a&gt; in January (jam games are allowed in 1GAM), so that will give me the month to get familiar with Unity and take care of my January entry. I'm probably going to build something simple in XNA for February just to relearn the library (again, unless something better catches my eye). After that, all bets are off. If I end up with a good track record for those first two months, I can start looking for teams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish me luck!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/402789858568258690/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/12/some-time-last-year-several-people-i.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/402789858568258690'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/402789858568258690'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/12/some-time-last-year-several-people-i.html' title='Keeping Motivated: One Game A Month'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5529869638494477324</id><published>2012-10-28T15:20:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2012-11-17T17:26:22.592-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Unfinished Swan Released</title><content type='html'>Way back in 2008, I was still in college. I had a free night among many and was surfing the night away on YouTube and CollegeHumor when I stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video/3722352/chill-game"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. I was immediately intrigued by this and proceeded to do some more research. The tech demo was for a game called Unfinished Swan which was being developed by a studio that would later be known as &lt;a href="http://giantsparrow.com/"&gt;Giant Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went nuts over this video. I showed it to everyone I knew and added the studio's blog to my RSS feed so I could keep track of them. Around the end of 2010, I started to lose hope. The blog has been quiet for almost 2 years. Their last post detailed a "company lunch" and the one before that was about the new couch they got for their studio. Around this point, I was ready to label this game as vaporware and forget about it. But when I re-read the post about the company lunch, at the end was hidden a nugget of hope: they were having a live demo at PAX of the next year. Development was still on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it finally happened. Unfinished Swan produced a new trailer and a release date. I could not wait for October of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice that October has mostly passed at this point. I own a copy of the game and have played it through once. So was it worth the wait? Hellz yeah it was! Over the past 4 years, I tried to imagine what I would use a mechanic like this for. Heck, I even gave it a shot myself (see The Great Inkscape under Projects to the right). Nearly everything I had imagined was implemented, and then some. The pacing was a little stunted and the story-telling method has you hunting around the game environment for story-book pages, all of which are entirely miss-able. The devs did a good job of making them obvious, but I'm pretty sure I missed a couple. Other than that, the central mechanic is used magnificently and evolves over the course of the game without really changing too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go out and pick up Unfinished Swan, available now for purchase on Playstation Network.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5529869638494477324/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/10/unfinished-swan-released.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5529869638494477324'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5529869638494477324'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/10/unfinished-swan-released.html' title='Unfinished Swan Released'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1234144016809242554</id><published>2012-05-31T17:13:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2012-05-31T17:16:15.496-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Update on what I've been doing</title><content type='html'>Ooooo. Blogspot updated their tools. Spiffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahem. So I'm about to start a new project with some friends. We're going to give "team development" a shot. This means my next project will actually have some art in it. Plus, I'll have other people around to keep me motivated. Currently, we're learning where everyone's skills lie and figuring out which roles in game dev suit them best. We're probably going to go with a third-party game building software, which somewhat diminishes how much I can contribute, since programming is my strong suit. The only other thing I know about the project is that it'll be a classical fantasy rpg. Actually, even the "fantasy" part could be changed. We don't even have a game idea yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I've been reading through the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/XNA-4-0-Game-Development-Example/dp/1849690669/"&gt;XNA 4.0 Beginner's Guide&lt;/a&gt;. It's a decent programming book. It uses 4 game projects of increasing complexity to teach you game programming in C#/XNA by example. The projects are laid out pretty nicely in a way that allows for adding of new features as the book teaches you different things about the XNA library. It doesn't spend very much time on the basics of C#, so it's not really for people who are completely new to programming. I'm currently about 3/4 through the 3rd example project and I've definitely learned quite a bit. I never thought that Vector Math would come in handy, or that I had actually been using it in all my previous games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, something everyone should check out:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://zanrai.com/heavenvariant/"&gt;Heaven Variant&lt;/a&gt;. This is a side-scrolling shooter currently in development by indie studio Zanrai Interactive. They're using the Unreal Development Kit for it and it looks AWESOME!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1234144016809242554/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/05/update-on-what-ive-been-doing.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1234144016809242554'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1234144016809242554'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/05/update-on-what-ive-been-doing.html' title='Update on what I&apos;ve been doing'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-921051606972769142</id><published>2012-04-14T00:04:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:49:15.374-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Basic Movement, Graphics, HUD, and Attacks</title><content type='html'>After three days of development, I have something that looks kind of like a game.

The dungeon in Quill's Gambit is going to be a randomly generated set of square rooms that can be connected at the top, bottom, left, or right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first idea for an algorithm was a "budding" system. Where the game would randomly pick an inactive room on a grid of rooms and make it the "bud". It would then "grow" rooms in a random direction, essentially building a "branch" that twists and turns in random directions. It generated dungeons that looked like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MfQwIbOHPzA/T4j1FdhZ_fI/AAAAAAAAAHo/avUqCKH-mdc/s1600/Bud01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MfQwIbOHPzA/T4j1FdhZ_fI/AAAAAAAAAHo/avUqCKH-mdc/s640/Bud01.png" height="500" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5AE6gNaSoeM/T4j1Fy16L2I/AAAAAAAAAHw/0LrJaDT9fic/s1600/Bud02.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5AE6gNaSoeM/T4j1Fy16L2I/AAAAAAAAAHw/0LrJaDT9fic/s640/Bud02.png" height="502" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too shabby. The issue that I had is that my initial algorithm wouldn't connect a new room to an already active room if the right direction was picked. So map generation time varied a lot, and trying to create too many rooms would result in what appeared to be an infinite loop that *might* exit at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution was to put in a "connection chance". Some small decimal, something like 0.1, that would dictate the chance that a "branch" would connect to an existing active room if the right direction was chosen. If the chance failed, then the "bud" for generation would be placed in a random active room. This proved a much better solution and created dungeons with longer hallways and loops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-TvJWfWpR8/T4j1_paIEUI/AAAAAAAAAH4/MnHYKDuOHSc/s1600/Vine01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-TvJWfWpR8/T4j1_paIEUI/AAAAAAAAAH4/MnHYKDuOHSc/s640/Vine01.png" height="502" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oqUHkz_PbgA/T4j1_-iANwI/AAAAAAAAAIA/91m5HP_qqug/s1600/Vine02.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oqUHkz_PbgA/T4j1_-iANwI/AAAAAAAAAIA/91m5HP_qqug/s640/Vine02.png" height="502" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I have my basic room layout generator. Now I get to add all the little things in between. As you can see in the second set of pictures above, I already experimented with selecting a start location. It's just the last room that was created. That guarantees that it will only have one exit, so as not to make the player choose right off the bat.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3294079662017626570/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/04/dungeon-generation.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3294079662017626570'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3294079662017626570'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/04/dungeon-generation.html' title='Dungeon Generation'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MfQwIbOHPzA/T4j1FdhZ_fI/AAAAAAAAAHo/avUqCKH-mdc/s72-c/Bud01.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7610427605915446903</id><published>2012-04-13T23:50:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:49:27.587-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>New Project</title><content type='html'>I'm thinking that I'm probably far enough along in a new project that I can post about it and have a reasonably good chance of seeing it through to the end. I've never gotten in to RogueLikes or Dungeon Crawlers, but I think that's because they never seemed all that...varied. Then, I played Torchlight. And I was blown away. I had never had so much fun just trouncing through a dungeon, waiting to see what the next awesome ability I would unlock was. I enjoyed the pointless sidequests and it actually had a pretty good story. That spurred me on a quest of my own, to find and try any hack-n-slash dungeon crawler I could get my hands on. Back then, I was spending a lot of my time on computers where I couldn't install anything. So I searched for the smallest dungeon crawler I could find that had a reasonable amount of visuals and variety. I found &lt;a href="http://www.desktopdungeons.net/"&gt;Desktop Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. A small, randomly generated single-floor roguelike. I still play it, almost 3 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also remembered reading an inspiring article: &lt;a href="http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/creative/game-design/how-to-build-a-game-in-a-week-from-scratch-with-r2259"&gt;How to Build a Game in a Week from Scratch&lt;/a&gt;. The author gives himself 40 hours of development time and limits himself to free tools. At the end of it all, he has a fairly buggy, but still impressive game. That was all I needed. I started work on my newest project. Quill's Gambit. A procedurally generated, hack-n-slash, dungeon crawler. Nothing too complicated. I need to be able to complete this in the small amount of spare time I seem to have nowadays.

They're hopefully going to keep me busier than my old one. The bad news is, that leave less time for personal projects. So this blog is going to see a very big decline in frequency of posts (if it hasn't already). So as something I can work on in the small amount of spare time I have, I've decided to take the plunge and try learning Flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with Flash is that there isn't very much choice when it comes to tools to use. Sure, you can use Notepad++ to write ActionScript documents, but whatever software you need to compile them into an .fla file, and then into a .swf file for use in the real world is incredibly limiting. Your only choice is Adobe Flash Professional. The full version costs about $700 and the trial only lasts 30 days. This limitation put me off from learning Flash until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/"&gt;FlashDevelop&lt;/a&gt;. A free Flash IDE. HOORAY!!! I downloaded immediately and dove right in. There are a number of differences between FlashDevelop and Adobe Flash Professional. FD doesn't have a timeline or any graphics creation tools built in. The layout and functionality is almost identical to Visual Studio. I suppose that'll make it easier to learn, but I'm a little put off by the lack of uniqueness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching around for some tutorials, I found &lt;a href="http://flashgamedojo.com/"&gt;Flash Game Dojo&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually led me to &lt;a href="http://flixel.org/"&gt;Flixel&lt;/a&gt;. I followed their tutorial for the EZPlatformer and found it to be surprisingly intuitive. Most game development libraries separate the game loop into an Update function and a Render/Draw function. Flixel (and Flash in general) just has an Update function. Everything is drawn for each game loop unless it is specifically set to invisible or moved out of the Stage area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it's not the best language I've ever encountered, but it probably has the best chance of fitting in with my pitiful excuse for a distribution model. I'll give it a shot and see what I can come up with.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/9072879325693023367/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/03/first-impressions-flash.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9072879325693023367'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9072879325693023367'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/03/first-impressions-flash.html' title='First Impressions - Flash'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1579151927958889188</id><published>2012-02-27T19:04:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2012-02-27T19:10:39.791-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Other Skills and Tools</title><content type='html'>I've been working on honing the other half of my programming skills: Web Development. All the websites I've built so far have been from scratch, and one where I used an MVC framework. For one of my latest projects, I'm giving WordPress a shot. I gotta say, if your website just showcases content, WordPress is the way to go. It doesn't have much support for custom databases. If you need custom data stored in a database, you might as well just code the site yourself. That being said, there isn't a whole lot that WordPress CAN'T do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest hurdle I found is that, since a lot of the plug-ins and themes are community built, there isn't a lot of compatibility between them. I tried adding a progress bar widget to my site, then I changed the theme, and the widget started malfunctioning. I put together a header menu and added some drop-down entries to it. It worked fine in the default Twenty-Eleven theme, but as soon as I switched to a different theme, the drop-down sections were displayed as top-level entries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the lesson here is this: working with a CMS like WordPress is great. It handles a ton of the commonly requested features for websites. The downside is that you have to deal with the CMS's interface and what has available. You have to learn how to get its toolset to do what you want it to, which is a little harder than it sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're just looking for blogging or new feeds, then it's definitely something for you. I may end up converting this blog to a custom hosted wordpress blog. That is, if I ever find another use for this site other than blogging. That will probably happen at the same time that I come up with a better name than Little HIVE.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1579151927958889188/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/other-skills-and-tools.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1579151927958889188'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1579151927958889188'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/other-skills-and-tools.html' title='Other Skills and Tools'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6602162549336405953</id><published>2012-02-22T20:56:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2012-02-22T20:56:54.879-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Lesson Learned</title><content type='html'>I wanted to share a tenant of game development that I had read about, but never experienced. I released The Great Inkscape into the wild, posted it on a few message boards. The result I got back was pretty shocking. Everyone thought it was too hard. I probably should have realized this when I got my first alpha tester, and she died 8 times before completing the first level, and that was only after I made a few alterations to make it easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson here is, if you are developing a game and you think it is just difficult enough, then it is probably WAY too hard. You've been playing this game for weeks (maybe months). You know all the quirks and tricks, most of which are probably not as obvious as you think. You are the *best* player in the world at this game right now. You have no equal, and won't until someone else puts as much exhaustive effort and time into this game as you have.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/6602162549336405953/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/lesson-learned.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6602162549336405953'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6602162549336405953'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/lesson-learned.html' title='Lesson Learned'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-4613224975914745953</id><published>2012-02-19T12:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:49:39.824-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Shelving the Project</title><content type='html'>I'm putting Candlehead on the shelf for now. Developing it just isn't fun anymore. The whole thing was kind of forced to being with. Not to mention life getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what can I learn from this experience? First off, it reinforces the idea that, when developing a game, you want to get something that is at least playable VERY quickly. That way, you can immediately see how changes you make and features you add will affect the entire game. Secondly, some ideas just don't make for fun games. Even the tech demos I came up with weren't very fun. The mechanic was more frustrating than actually enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Candlehead is going on the back burner for now. We'll see what my next project ends up being. My research says that &lt;a href="http://www.dreambuildplay.com/Main/Default.aspx"&gt;Dream.Build.Play&lt;/a&gt; is coming up.

Candlehead marks a couple of firsts for me. This is the first time that I've given the player the ability to customize their controls. It is also the first time that I've done anything with lighting and shadows. I had to increase the size of the screen a little. It turns out that an 800x600 resolution isn't evenly dividable into 32x32 tiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn't much to the lighting code. It's just a screen-sized image that's drawn in a semi-transparent black. I have a sprite of a transparent radial gradient (goes from black to transparent as you move to the center) that I scale based on the strength of the light. I don't know if other game libraries do this, but Pygame's default scaling transform asks for a specific size rather than a multiplier. So that's nice. I realize that not all computers have the same brightness, so I'll be adding a slider to the options screen so the player can change the brightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I built the basic platforming engine and implemented a simple tileset. The player can also adjust the strength of the candle flame at the cost of changing the rate at which they run out of wax. There is going to be a lot of tweaking as far as the wax drain rate, the player movement speed, and the flame strength. But they all work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have the basic classes for the two (technically, three) types of enemies: Timid Monstrosity Walk, Timid Monstrosity Fly, and Roaming Monstrosity. They're just placeholders for now. I've only really drawn the main character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now...SCREENSHOTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qsBGi2qzvsU/TzHbxq22eKI/AAAAAAAAAGw/wRelSBIyZcE/s1600/Screenshot02.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qsBGi2qzvsU/TzHbxq22eKI/AAAAAAAAAGw/wRelSBIyZcE/s320/Screenshot02.jpg" height="265" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The basic Options screen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Arbb2sXH9a4/TzHbx0ogedI/AAAAAAAAAG4/RloZy-CvWFs/s1600/Screenshot03.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Arbb2sXH9a4/TzHbx0ogedI/AAAAAAAAAG4/RloZy-CvWFs/s320/Screenshot03.jpg" height="265" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The start of a game screen.

It has everything an artist could need, including a high price tag. As a rather frugal indie developer, I tend to like my programs as free as possible. I do my development in Notepad++ or PyScripter and all my programming libraries are free and open source. Historically, I've gone with GIMP. It is (sort of) similar to Photoshop and is open source. I am not an artist by any means, but my needs are a little too great for MS Paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides GIMP, one of the other freeware graphics program that indie game developers use for their 2D art is Inkscape. Inkscape is a vector graphics program. That means that, instead of tracking individual pixels in an image, Inkscape stores formulas and equations for every line you draw and every shape you put into the image. So that, when you scale vector images, they never get that grainy pixelated look. They are always smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be because I've used GIMP for so long, but I just could not get a handle on how Inkscape does things. It took me all afternoon just to follow the first tutorial that has you draw the Greek flag, which should be dead simple. GIMP may be overly complicated for my needs, but I know how it works and I can get it to do what I want more often than not. So try Inkscape, but only if you're not already entrenched with another graphics program.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2290551757973410579/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/art-program-wars.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2290551757973410579'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2290551757973410579'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/art-program-wars.html' title='Art Program Wars'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1820008830701424693</id><published>2012-02-06T19:47:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.664-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Different Order</title><content type='html'>I'm changing the order that I usually do things around. Usually, I focus on the gameplay and level design first before I tack on a title screen and options and a full game cycle and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this time, I'm trying it in a different order. I have a prototype already of how I think the gameplay is going to work. At the very least, it proves that I can adequately render a light source in 2D (go me!). So, I went ahead and got started on the...framing device of the game, shall we say. I've got a rudimentary title screen and a controls/options screen that is fully functional. Now that that's out of the way, I can start working on the gameplay and it will look more like a full game right from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVcZvgMcz2w/TzB0dwCxaCI/AAAAAAAAAGo/xhwMiYs1kGg/s1600/Screenshot01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="249" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVcZvgMcz2w/TzB0dwCxaCI/AAAAAAAAAGo/xhwMiYs1kGg/s320/Screenshot01.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;My first draft of the Title Screen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I mention that I might be commissioning some work from an ACTUAL ARTIST.

It reminded me of the power outage we had a few weeks ago. I remembered trying to brush my teeth by candlelight. Then it hit me: we should get some more flashlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it hit me again: I bet I could make a game around this. After all, the developers of Angry Birds started with nothing more than a picture of what eventually became the bird mascot of the game. So I decided to take the concept of "candles" and see if I could design a game around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is Candlehead. A(nother) 2D platformer based around the idea of hiding things from the player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Character&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will play a living candle. You can walk, jump, and make your flame burn brighter or dimmer. Your body will be made of wax. The flame will steadily drain your wax until you run out, at which point the flame will go out and you will have to navigate in darkness. Making your flame burn brighter will illuminate more of your environment, but it will also make your wax drain faster. This could be a good thing too, as your size is dependent on how much wax you have. If you have too much wax, you will not be able to fit through some of the passageways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enemies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timid Monstrosities - creatures that can see and be seen in the dark via their glowing eyes. They are afraid of light and will run away from you if your light is burning brightly. If your light dims or goes out, then they will eat the wax that makes up your body and kill you. There will be a walking type and a flying type.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roaming Monstrosities - creatures that cannot see or be seen in the dark. They can be heard, however. They are harmless if they can't see you, but will attack you if your flame is burning brightly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Items and Interactables&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pick up bits of wax to refill your supply a little. There will be other flame sources that you can use to relight your flame. There will be wax stations that you can use to refill your wax to full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Premise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have displeases your wizard master by attempting to woo a girl with one of his magic adjustable-brightness candles. These candles are very hard to make, that was your master's last one. In his displeasure, he decides to teach you a lesson and turns you into an adjustable-brightness candle. He does this as you are running out the door into a storm. The rain carries you away and down a storm drain. You have to get through the sewer and back to your master's workshop so he can turn you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am drawing a little inspiration from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airball_%28video_game%29"&gt;Airball&lt;/a&gt;. Airball is an old DOS game that I used to have. You are a rubber ball of air with a slow leak. An evil wizard has trapped you in his massive mansion and you have to escape without deflating or popping. Littered through the mansion are refilling stations that will refill you with air, but staying on one for too long will cause you to pop. It had decent graphics but terrible controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't made a game yet where lighting mattered. So that will be something new. I also wanted this one to look better than The Great Inkscape. I don't have the luxury of everything having to be only two colors. I debated using this project as motivation to learn Lua and Love2D, but I think I'm going to stick to Python and Pygame for now.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3797066176871865352/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/inspiration-strikes_04.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3797066176871865352'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3797066176871865352'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/inspiration-strikes_04.html' title='Inspiration Strikes'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-4099550750386648160</id><published>2012-02-02T08:20:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2012-02-06T20:05:14.852-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Programmer's Block</title><content type='html'>So it's been a couple days since The Great Inkscape was released. It is a pretty good feeling to watch the download counters slowly creep up. However, the good feeling is dampened by the fact that I have yet to receive any feedback on the game. I expected that, seeing as how I didn't advertise it very much, other than here and pygame.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, waiting for inspiration sucks. I keep a folder of ideas that I've come up with over the years, but most of them are too complicated, too simple, or downright impossible for me to build on my own with the skills I have now. When I first started making games, my research said that the typical ladder of progress goes: Pong -&amp;gt; Breakout -&amp;gt; Tetris -&amp;gt; Pac-Man -&amp;gt; Mario. Meaning, you build an extremely simple game, then add a scoring system and levels, then add a puzzle element and increasing difficulties, then add enemies, then add actual levels. Following that sequence is supposed to take you from beginner game developer, to being able to construct your own ideas. I've reached the end of the road. I've built a puzzle platformer. Now, supposedly, I have enough skill to run with my own unique ideas and make the games I want to play. Unfortunately, when the options are endless, I can't decide on any of them.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4099550750386648160/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/programmers-block.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4099550750386648160'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4099550750386648160'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/02/programmers-block.html' title='Programmer&apos;s Block'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5836690555915343454</id><published>2012-01-28T19:38:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:50:24.733-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>The Great Inkscape Version 0.1.0.0</title><content type='html'>I'm not sure if all projects come to this point near the end of their development.

All the features I set down in the design have been implemented, at least to my satisfaction. This is only the second game I've created that made it to this stage in development that had any substance. Sure, I've made arcade type games like Dodge 'Em. But those are EXTREMELY simple and didn't seem to give me the full experience of making a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My play-testers have suggested putting in a finale of some kind, like a boss fight. Something to give resolution to the story. I agree that the game ends pretty abruptly. I'll put some thought into some kind of finale. In the meantime, enjoy the latest build! There's a slight possibility that it will be the last.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5836690555915343454/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/great-inkscape-version-0100.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5836690555915343454'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5836690555915343454'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/great-inkscape-version-0100.html' title='The Great Inkscape Version 0.1.0.0'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-2554015965017287339</id><published>2012-01-28T14:51:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:50:31.631-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>The Great Inkscape Version 0.0.0.2</title><content type='html'>New version is up on the Project Site.

Version 0.0.0.1 (Extreme Alpha)</title><content type='html'>First a general progress report. Level 5 has been ink-tested. It is possible to navigate your way through the level without being able to see all the platforms. So that's nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that I was going to have to do something about the way my levels were stored. Currently, they're just plain text. Anybody with ANY knowledge of computers (can you open a .txt file?) would be able to open my levels.dat file and get a complete map of the levels. That would be a big hit to a game where the whole gimmick is based around not knowing your way around the levels. I didn't need to put too much thought into it. If someone really tried, they would have no problem extracting my level data from the distributable. I just wanted it to be a little harder than "open text file. Oh, THAT'S where the platform is". So I built a quick little script that loads the data for each level, then &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html#the-pickle-module"&gt;pickles&lt;/a&gt; them. The size of the game went up by about a MB after that, but what's memory cost nowadays?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing. Here's the credits screen I put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q0ce_jvzFXg/TyNQF-JCpqI/AAAAAAAAAGc/G_8W6IQGtuw/s1600/Screenshot20.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q0ce_jvzFXg/TyNQF-JCpqI/AAAAAAAAAGc/G_8W6IQGtuw/s320/Screenshot20.jpg" height="251" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, here is the alpha release for your viewing pleasure. I have chosen Google Code for my project hosting. This version has no enemies, no checkpoints, and no sound. It does, however, have God Mode activated, so you don't have to worry about losing great swaths of progress. This is strictly to see if the gameplay itself is fun, without the story and without the suspense, and if it'll run on someone else's computer. Just download, unzip, and run main.exe. Hopefully, this will work on anyone's Windows setup. &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/the-great-inkscape/downloads/list"&gt;ENJOY!!&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5429820817686482434/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/now-available-version-0001-extreme.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5429820817686482434'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5429820817686482434'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/now-available-version-0001-extreme.html' title='Now Available!!

Levels 1-4 have been ink-tested, meaning I went through them without debug mode to make sure the player could use ink to navigate them. Once I go back and add enemies, checkpoints, and messages and throw together a credits screen, the game will be pretty much done and ready for alpha testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't decided on a story for this game yet. I'm probably going to rely on the messages to tell it. The biggest issue with coming up with a story is the lack of a setting to help tell it. There are no set pieces in a game like this. The player has no sense of the type of place they're navigating. I have played a few games that took place in extremely minimalistic environments. They took place in spaceships or test chambers. Maybe I'll go the spaceship route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, here is set of before-and-after screenshots of my Controls screen.

I removed the enemies for now so I can focus on making the platforming fun. I've tested each level out with debug mode on, so next will be testing if the player can make it through the levels without being able to see the platforms and hazards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rmYrL5P69hA/Tx99C-O4RxI/AAAAAAAAAFc/BloQ8UJkOOQ/s1600/Screenshot17.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rmYrL5P69hA/Tx99C-O4RxI/AAAAAAAAAFc/BloQ8UJkOOQ/s320/Screenshot17.jpg" height="143" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've drawn a rudimentary death animation for the character. I guess he's supposed to be blowing up. I had wanted the player dying to spawn a group of ink balls that would scatter and paint the hazard the player ran in to. This wouldn't be necessary for the Polar Pigs (as I'm going to name them) because they can't kill you unless they're already inked. The problem with spawning the ink balls upon death is that the player is already inside the collision box for the hazard. So, while the paint balls do the job and color the hazard for the player to see, they do so after only one frame. The player doesn't see the paint balls fly. For now I'm just going to draw the hazard the player ran in to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a performance issue with Level 3. Levels 1, 2, and 4 are made up of about 3500 tiles each. Level 3 is made up of 9000. For some reason, that many tiles caused enough of a resource drain that the frame rate suffered. However, the problem went away as soon as I turned Debug mode off. So it looks like the problem was making the game draw all the walls, even those that were off-screen. I turned Debug mode back on, but made the game check if a wall was on screen before drawing it. Performance went back to normal after that.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8711991184748391148/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/death-animation-and-performace-issues.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8711991184748391148'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8711991184748391148'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/death-animation-and-performace-issues.html' title='Death Animation and Performace Issues'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rmYrL5P69hA/Tx99C-O4RxI/AAAAAAAAAFc/BloQ8UJkOOQ/s72-c/Screenshot17.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-6320670925372887275</id><published>2012-01-23T21:12:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:50:53.986-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Drawing and Animating Sprites without Details are Hard</title><content type='html'>I've encountered one the difficulties with drawing for a game where the primary gimmick is color tricks: It is impossible to put details into sprites that can be only one color. I originally made the enemies in the shape of Ghosts because they were simple, slightly scary, and made good placeholders. I had imagined replacing them with some kind of really detailed yeti monster or something. But every time I went to add detail to the new sprite, I kept having to remind myself "No outlining, no shading. You can't use ANY other colors". So here are the old and new enemy sprites. The new one looks better when animated, but kind of reminds me of a combination of a polar bear and a white pig or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5TwXz-2-TrY/Tx4S4VE0HkI/AAAAAAAAAFM/tF6lStQgbQE/s1600/Screenshot15.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5TwXz-2-TrY/Tx4S4VE0HkI/AAAAAAAAAFM/tF6lStQgbQE/s320/Screenshot15.jpg" height="320" width="179" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ghost Sprite Placeholder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-le2_RFqoYKg/Tx4S4z1yY9I/AAAAAAAAAFU/EyFjwhKpmsk/s1600/Screenshot16.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-le2_RFqoYKg/Tx4S4z1yY9I/AAAAAAAAAFU/EyFjwhKpmsk/s320/Screenshot16.jpg" height="147" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Bear-pig...thing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The second screenshot also showcases the animation of the enemy getting soaked in ink. I realized that there wasn't enough time between a player accidentally soaking an enemy with ink and the enemy starting to pursue the player (read: there was NO time between. It was instantaneous). So I added some time to show the enemy actually getting soaked to give the player time to process what was coming next. The monster is there, and it is NOT happy.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/6320670925372887275/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/drawing-and-animating-sprites-without.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6320670925372887275'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/6320670925372887275'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/drawing-and-animating-sprites-without.html' title='Drawing and Animating Sprites without Details are Hard'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5TwXz-2-TrY/Tx4S4VE0HkI/AAAAAAAAAFM/tF6lStQgbQE/s72-c/Screenshot15.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7541077228331059769</id><published>2012-01-23T19:53:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:51:00.100-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>New Level and TaskList</title><content type='html'>So Level 3 of 5 has been built.

Here's a dump of what remains on my ToDo list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re-draw the Enemy Sprite. Ghosts are fine for placeholders, but I'm thinking something more detailed. Like Polar Bears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build Level 4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build Level 5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draw Player Death animations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build in Game Over or "After Death" functions. My levels are getting kind of big, so I'll probably add checkpoints to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add "winding up" code to the enemy. Currently, the enemies chase the player immediately after they get inked.

I can get away with this because this is just a hobby of mine. I didn't plan on making my older games super polished or profitable, so I never bothered having them play-tested. The other reason is my lack of play testers. I know I could just release it to the internet with a "Hey guyz, check out my game and tell me what you think", but I'd rather avoid the great swaths of "Game suckzorz. You're stupid and should stop living".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally managed to get a good friend to sit down and try The Great Inkscape out while I watched. Man, what an enlightenment. Nothing beats having a fresh perspective who wasn't there when you made the decision to increase the gravity from 0.7 to 0.9 (and doesn't care, frankly). I learned that there was so much I needed to fix. My controls were shit, the player jumped too fast, and having the ink fly in one of two types of arcs was severely limiting. I also got the reactions I was hoping for. My tester literally shrieked the first time she accidentally sprayed a ghost with ink. I had god mode on, so she couldn't die, but the game still scared her! It was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of this story is, even if it's only one person, have someone else try out your game. It goes a very long way towards making your game better.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3184884809895215162/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/first-tester.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3184884809895215162'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3184884809895215162'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/first-tester.html' title='First Tester'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1459634019576328913</id><published>2012-01-21T15:55:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.652-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>This is turning out to be pretty scary</title><content type='html'>I have to say, the sounds make a HUGE difference in the dynamic of a game. I've just about completed the first two levels of The Great Inkscape and added sound. A sound like a monster growling plays when you get within a certain distance of one of the ghosts and a sound like a monster screaming plays whenever you get a ghost soaked in ink, at which point they will chase you until the ink wears off. I'm the developer. Everything you play, I put there. And even I get nervous and scared when I play this game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for general progress. I've animated the main character a little. I'll have to change the title screen as he's not a walking blue box anymore. I've added enemies in the form of Ghosts. Normally, the ghosts are white (and therefore, invisible). They pass in front of the player, so if the player feels brave enough, he can just walk right past them. This has the disadvantage of not being able to freely shoot ink out. The Ghosts are programmed to switch direction upon encountering a drop, a wall, or a hazard/spike. When enraged by the player shooting them with ink, their movement speed triples and they pursue the player. They will jump over walls and drops while pursuing, but will not avoid hazards. This should open up some interesting opportunities for the player to lure a Ghost into a trap. I've also added messages that are drawn into the background of the level. I figure they would be a good way to explain the game to the player. Currently, only the first level has any messages. I may not bother putting more in as one level is really all I need to explain things (I think). Here are some new screenshots:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PpXr-hJtt14/TxsltZGy5-I/AAAAAAAAAEc/XcjaOkSkw2c/s1600/Screenshot09.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PpXr-hJtt14/TxsltZGy5-I/AAAAAAAAAEc/XcjaOkSkw2c/s320/Screenshot09.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The first thing you see upon starting the first level&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IXTJbYzIGCs/Txsltw3gXbI/AAAAAAAAAEk/tLnQr9W0oIc/s1600/Screenshot10.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IXTJbYzIGCs/Txsltw3gXbI/AAAAAAAAAEk/tLnQr9W0oIc/s320/Screenshot10.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;For what??&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2nTdNeQj9vM/TxsluA8nczI/AAAAAAAAAEs/TKUIhGubaY8/s1600/Screenshot11.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2nTdNeQj9vM/TxsluA8nczI/AAAAAAAAAEs/TKUIhGubaY8/s320/Screenshot11.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Oh...That's what you meant&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--hcCz9T3F5w/TxsluVfTGbI/AAAAAAAAAE0/blgnNqkwlK8/s1600/Screenshot12.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--hcCz9T3F5w/TxsluVfTGbI/AAAAAAAAAE0/blgnNqkwlK8/s320/Screenshot12.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The first ghost the player encounters.

Drawing them on the walls is easy. I track the ink balls that the player throws. When they collide with a wall, I build a bounded box for the "spray area" at the center of the ball when it collided with the wall. I take every wall that collides with that bounded box and determine what section of the ink splatter sprite it takes up using the origin of the ink ball as the center of the ink splatter sprite. After storing that rectangle, it's a simple matter of drawing that clip if the ink splatter sprite when the game renders the walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qqvna9fuJXo/TxirgmG8XQI/AAAAAAAAAEU/71ElkVrA2gw/s1600/Screenshot08.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qqvna9fuJXo/TxirgmG8XQI/AAAAAAAAAEU/71ElkVrA2gw/s1600/Screenshot08.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Getting the drawing on the spikes was a little harder, because they are technically an arbitrary shape. I tried using the pygame.transform.average_surfaces() function, but there are two issues: the function doesn't handle transparencies very well, and it averages the colors of the image instead of multiplying them (see right). I ended up creating a smaller image, the clip of the ink splatter sprite that would normally be drawn on a wall in the spike's position, and looping through the individual pixels of the spike sprite and the clip. I created a third image that was black wherever the pixels in both the spike and the clip were black, and transparent everywhere else. Fortunately, I only do this operation when the spike is actually hit by an ink ball. So the image is created once and stored in memory. It is deleted when the splatter moves off screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next task will be to create enemies. This will mark the first time that I have used sound in one of my games. There will be one type of enemy. It will be entirely white (therefore invisible). The player will be made aware of its presence by the sound of growling. That will be the player's cue to be VERY careful with their paint. The enemies are harmless and docile when dry, but once you get paint on them, they become enraged and try to eat you!! The paint drips off after a little while, but they'll still be there.&amp;nbsp; I haven't decided whether to make them pursue the player relentlessly (jumping on platforms and over pits) or just run at them until they hit a wall, at which point they'll just run into the wall ineffectually.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5030933551675809330/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/progress.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5030933551675809330'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5030933551675809330'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/progress.html' title='Progress!!! and Moar Screenshots!!!'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mpqA4HvM8Lo/Txin4kDg1pI/AAAAAAAAADs/m-YL-W-3x6M/s72-c/Screenshot04.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-585028146262311330</id><published>2012-01-18T21:25:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.738-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Darn It!!! Alright...new project!</title><content type='html'>Since Unbalanced Equation has almost completely lost momentum, and I'm enjoying Python soooo much, here's the new project: The Great Ink-scape. (As in "The Great Escape" eh? eh?). I'm setting my sights a little lower for this one. One weapon, old-school level progression (Super Mario Bros. not Castlevania), 2D platforming, no exploration, one type of enemy (maybe two), and 5 levels (at most).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm almost pulling a Portal on this one. Let me explain. You may recall, back when Portal 1 was the talk of the decade, some smart Flash developer over at NewGrounds.com created&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404612"&gt;Portal: The Flash Version&lt;/a&gt; for those of us who owned computers not powerful enough to run the actual Portal. It was a neat little game and successfully scratched many a Portal-itch. I'm going to be doing the same thing (creating a 2D version of a 3D game) except my 3D game, the source of my inspiration, hasn't been released yet. I'm speaking of &lt;a href="http://giantsparrow.com/games/swan/"&gt;Unfinished Swan&lt;/a&gt;. This incredibly unique first-person-adventure hooked my interest in 2006. I have been following their development ever since. But come on! When the most interesting thing you've done in the past year is a team-lunch at the Curry House, development must not be going too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say, Darn it!!! I'll do it myself.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/585028146262311330/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/darn-it-alrightnew-project.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/585028146262311330'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/585028146262311330'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/darn-it-alrightnew-project.html' title='Darn It!!!

I had an idea a while ago for a 2D platformer where you are equipped with a paint gun. You would have different types of paint that would affect enemies in different ways. Back when I had this idea, I wasn't experienced enough to think out how the code would work. It was too arbitrary and there was too much to think about for my skill level. This is really the first time I've done something like this without intending to make a full-fledged project out of it. It only took me a few hours to put together using Python and PyGame. I haven't decided on a project hosting service yet, so you'll have to make due with screenshots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FXJdJKd9XDo/TxYDM2WUDXI/AAAAAAAAADU/JvvVgd2LtFo/s1600/Screenshot01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FXJdJKd9XDo/TxYDM2WUDXI/AAAAAAAAADU/JvvVgd2LtFo/s320/Screenshot01.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The single-screen wold for playing around in&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mQc4DFRfrzw/TxYDNO2ZHtI/AAAAAAAAADc/mqfLZBg6AzA/s1600/Screenshot02.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mQc4DFRfrzw/TxYDNO2ZHtI/AAAAAAAAADc/mqfLZBg6AzA/s320/Screenshot02.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Firing paint around and watching the world react to it&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8ocHw3QnnbA/TxYDNoKW9II/AAAAAAAAADg/-tBgSZruABk/s1600/Screenshot03.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8ocHw3QnnbA/TxYDNoKW9II/AAAAAAAAADg/-tBgSZruABk/s320/Screenshot03.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Covering the other guy in paint and watching him get really angry&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/2606519666983352869/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/something-new.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2606519666983352869'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/2606519666983352869'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/something-new.html' title='Something New'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FXJdJKd9XDo/TxYDM2WUDXI/AAAAAAAAADU/JvvVgd2LtFo/s72-c/Screenshot01.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7560096463408863295</id><published>2012-01-15T13:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.759-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>New Textures - Cavern</title><content type='html'>I seem to be spending a lot of time posting about new art assets.

That is, software that you can run off a USB key and not have to rely on a PC having anything special installed. This is a bit of a waste to me now, since I do all my computer work on one of 2 computers and I have (almost) complete control over what goes on both of them. It would have been much more useful back when I was in college and spent a good deal of time working on the library computers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I have amassed a pretty good sized collection of portable software. My latest addition is Love2D. At just 3.8 MB, it is the smallest game programming library that boasts everything necessary to build and run any 2D game while still being relatively easy to use that I have ever encountered. It will definitely be the next thing that I start learning once Wizard Plumber is finished.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8627268065625950715/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-small-can-library-be.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8627268065625950715'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8627268065625950715'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-small-can-library-be.html' title='How small can your tools get?'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-706654416287483498</id><published>2012-01-13T21:26:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:55:12.825-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Screenshots?

The basic point of this game is to rotate the pipes on screen to get the water from the emitters to the receivers. I will probably have a better name for those down the line. The gimmick is that you can draw a line across a stream of water and create a "Magic Pipe" that will redirect the water in the direction you draw the line. Currently, the game is restricted to the water moving at right angles. The puzzles aren't that hard at the moment. They either need a redone concept, or a better level designer then me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the gameplay screenshots, the red boxes are the emitters, the green boxes that fill up with yellow are the receivers, the gray pipes are the normal pipes that are placed when the level starts and can be rotated, the orange pipes are "Magic Pipes", and the blue particles are...water.

It just doesn't seem natural that the character can jump 5x his height but can only travel 2 tiles horizontally when jumping. Here are some screenshots of the new area, without textures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Je7kWfx1nLo/TxDktwlfRTI/AAAAAAAAACU/3oTyI3Rbqz0/s1600/Screenshot12.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Je7kWfx1nLo/TxDktwlfRTI/AAAAAAAAACU/3oTyI3Rbqz0/s320/Screenshot12.png" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b_sAR8UB2ks/TxDkzITCU0I/AAAAAAAAACc/rAi0cxTT-kc/s1600/Screenshot13.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b_sAR8UB2ks/TxDkzITCU0I/AAAAAAAAACc/rAi0cxTT-kc/s320/Screenshot13.png" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one showcases the Flamethrower weapon.

You may notice that they don't show up as the ugly red boxes anymore. This makes it so that the player doesn't transition between rooms until they actually touch the border of the window. I had to retouch up a few of the platforms so that navigation between all the rooms was still possible, but I think it functions a lot better now.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/9008714778873195139/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-area-built-clouds.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9008714778873195139'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/9008714778873195139'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-area-built-clouds.html' title='New Area Built - Clouds'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Je7kWfx1nLo/TxDktwlfRTI/AAAAAAAAACU/3oTyI3Rbqz0/s72-c/Screenshot12.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5552776964063065653</id><published>2012-01-11T19:18:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.733-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Double Jump...or Run</title><content type='html'>I originally wanted the third upgrade to your arsenal in Unbalanced Equation to be a double jump.

I realized something I probably should have realized a long time ago. Your levels are going to suck the first time around. You can save yourself a lot of headache if you just accept this fact. Just put something into the game, play it, THEN worry about balance, increasing difficulty, and so forth. It's amazing what you will come up with once you have something on the screen that you can play around with. In the end, that's what level design should be. Smacking a design together with a little thought put in to things like "Is this solvable?", putting it into the game, and THEN tweaking it, redesigning it, and trying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too often in the past, I would get bogged down worrying about difficulty, balance, and player interest in the initial phases of level design. And that would stop me from getting anything done. Not anymore! Tomorrow, I give my first 10 levels a dry run, then I build the next 10.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3010357698928551957/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/level-designyay.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3010357698928551957'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3010357698928551957'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/level-designyay.html' title='Level design...YAY!'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8859286874930742203</id><published>2012-01-10T18:38:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:55:51.256-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Level Design...Ugh</title><content type='html'>I have now come to the point that always seems to stop me cold in my projects.

I used implement the pipes as Node objects. Each Node had a main Particle Receiver so that Particles couldn't just breeze on through in the wrong direction, and at least 2 Receiver/Emitter pairs for each end of the pipe. That meant that an X-pipe junction had 9 objects to keep track of, and each one had to be checked for collisions with the Particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the pipes are the much simpler Pipe objects. They have one bounded box and a list of acceptable directions. Whenever a particle collides with the Pipe object, the object checks the Particle's direction. If the direction is on the Pipe's list of acceptable directions, the Pipe emits particles in each other direction on its list. I may not have improved the efficiency a whole lot (It didn't go from O(n2) to O(log(n))), but the difference between being able to only have 2000 particles on screen before the frame rate starts to suffer and having 8000 particles is huge! And just what I needed to keep things smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next change will be to fix the code that creates the Magic Pipes. Currently, the game checks if the line you draw intersects the emit-line that comes out of any of the pipes, regardless if there's another pipe in between or if you're drawing between two pipes. I'm going to have it track the flow of water instead. The Water System is going to build an array of lines each time you try creating a Magic Pipe that will represent the flow of water, and THAT is the array that will be checked for intersections.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5530692839999701304/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/optimization.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5530692839999701304'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5530692839999701304'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/optimization.html' title='Optimization'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-7820909467396005704</id><published>2012-01-08T15:26:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.764-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>New Enemy: Pew Pew Pew</title><content type='html'>I've added a new enemy type to the game.

So I started in on a new project. One that I'm ONLY going to work on when I'm not at home. Python and PyGame are available in portable versions and won't take up much room on my USB Drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the working title of the new game is Wizard Plumber. It will be a single-screen puzzler. There will be a source of water on one side of the screen, and one or more water receivers elsewhere on the screen. The player will be able to rotate pipes at fixed locations on the screen to try and get the water from the source to all the receivers. The cool part is that the player will have 3 "magic pipes" that they can place wherever they want to force the water to turn at a right angle. Once placed, these magic pipes cannot be moved or rotated, but they can be taken back, rotated, and placed somewhere else. Rotating a regular pipe is done by simply clicking on one and placing a magic pipe is done by dragging the mouse over a water stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I implemented my own simple particle system to control the water. I ran into some trouble initially when I started placing too many pipes on the screen. At about 1000 particles, the framerate slowed noticeably. I was only looping through the particle array 3 times: once for updating, once for collision checking, and once for rendering. After searching around online a bit, I found out that there's a better approach than what I was using. My particles were, in code, represented as a List of Objects. After converting them to a List of Lists (or struts if you prefer), I could have 2000 particles on screen before the framerate started slowing down. I needed about 12 pipes placed at the farthest ends of the screen to get that many particles. I'll think about trying to optimize this when I get to actually designing puzzles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, my pipes are implemented as Node objects. A Node has one or more Particle Emitters and one or more Particle Receivers. A typical Node will have a central Receiver to prevent particles from just passing through it, and an Emitter-Receiver pair for each end of the pipe that the Node can receive or emit water from. This means that a Node representing a T-junction pipe has 7 objects in it. All of which need updating and collision checking as the Particle System moves along. That probably wasn't the best solution. I'm going to go back and rewrite the Node class so that it only contains a central Rectangle for receiving particles, and one Rectangle for each end of its pipe for emitting particles. It will know which directions it can receive particles from, and, from there, it can extrapolate which directions it needs to emit particles from when stimulated by a stream of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeowza, that's a lot of text. But that's understandable. I've already been working on this project for about 18 hours (not straight, of course), so there's bound to be a lot to catch up on. Sadly, I probably won't be able to post any screenshots since I'm trying to keep this separate from my main project.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3446932638594079699/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/whistle-while-you-work.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3446932638594079699'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3446932638594079699'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/whistle-while-you-work.html' title='Whistle while you Work'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1397116079406015172</id><published>2012-01-07T21:12:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.639-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Getting Ahead of Myself</title><content type='html'>Design, then test, then continue design, then test. I have encountered the dangers of working out of sequence. I try to keep fairly detailed notes about what I want to do next, but sometimes the opportunity is just there. I graphed out 2 more areas for Unbalanced Equation: Cloud and Cavern, but while I was building Cavern in the game itself, I had to keep reminding myself what my intended sequence is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that I have for the sequence of play is this: the player makes their way to the Plains and encounters a fork. One path is blocked by Barrier 3 and leads to the Clouds, one path is blocked by Barrier 4 and leads to the Mountains, and the last path is unblocked and leads to the Cavern. In the Cavern, the player will obtain Weapon 3. The player will backtrack to the fork in Plains, and use Weapon 3 to break down Barrier 3 and proceed into Clouds. While in Clouds, the player will enter a room that will stop them from backtracking. They will obtain Weapon 4 in this room and be forced to proceed to a boss battle in Clouds. I haven't decided what this battle will be or what Weapons 3 and 4 will be. I know that, after defeating the boss in Clouds, the player will be sent to a different section of Cavern and use Weapon 4 to break down a barrier. The player will proceed through the areas Ruins, Water, and a section of the Final Lair before finally arriving back at the fork in Plains. The player will use Weapon 4 to break down the barrier and proceed with the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huff, huff. So there's a "short" guide to the middle of the game as it is so far.

I downloaded the Python port to give it a try. After downgrading my copies of Python and Pygame, I finally got Box2D's blank testbed console to fire up. I dove into the source code and told it to load one of the pre-packaged testbeds so I could see what it could do. I was extremely surprised at what happened over the next half hour. I actually sat there, debugging this library, just to get one of their prepackaged showcases to work. I realize a few things could have gone wrong: I had the wrong versions, I wasn't launching the tests right, I hadn't configured everything properly. But what really pissed me off was that there wasn't any documentation beyond the API anywhere. All the tutorials and FAQs that I found were for Box2D 2.1, which hasn't even made it out of alpha yet! I also understand that Python was one of the later ports of Box2D and not the most popular. Maybe I'll dig out my C++ compiler and give that version a try *shudder*</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8743233158056277710/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/incompatibilities-and-open-source.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8743233158056277710'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8743233158056277710'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/incompatibilities-and-open-source.html' title='Incompatibilities and Open Source'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8q7Y6KezXzc/TwO2fnAXqEI/AAAAAAAAABs/W6AV6ojfzqE/s72-c/box2dIcon.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5230809549607554923</id><published>2012-01-03T21:03:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.723-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Dead Rock Monster</title><content type='html'>So the Rock Monster now has a corpse, and the room alters its landscape after you kill it so that you can proceed and get the Flamethrower:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K0HzD_vfPQw/TwOzfZxi_rI/AAAAAAAAABg/lD00bg0gMLs/s1600/Screenshot7.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K0HzD_vfPQw/TwOzfZxi_rI/AAAAAAAAABg/lD00bg0gMLs/s320/Screenshot7.png" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5230809549607554923/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/dead-rock-monster.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5230809549607554923'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5230809549607554923'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/dead-rock-monster.html' title='Dead Rock Monster'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K0HzD_vfPQw/TwOzfZxi_rI/AAAAAAAAABg/lD00bg0gMLs/s72-c/Screenshot7.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-3333328892709354452</id><published>2012-01-02T23:29:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2012-01-13T21:19:34.863-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>A Level Designer's Best Friend</title><content type='html'>I gotta say, level design is sooooooo much easier when you have graph paper and a plain text representation of your levels like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;0000000000&lt;br /&gt;0000000000&lt;br /&gt;1111000000&lt;br /&gt;0000000000&lt;br /&gt;0000000111&lt;br /&gt;0000000000&lt;br /&gt;0000000000&lt;br /&gt;1111111111&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;To think I thought I was hot stuff when I wanted to store my level design as XML.

This is where it's getting interesting. The Plains are is going to act as a sort of hub, in as far as you go through it the most number of times. For a MetroidVania platformer, this is turning out to be pretty linear. I have an extremely clear idea of the correct path to take through the landscape and there's very little opportunity for a player to deviate. If I were to take screenshots, they wouldn't look much different from the shots of the Cave before I've added textures. Just black boxes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've discovered two possible issues with regard to expressing information to the player. I haven't decided on a way to express to the player that the next room they have to go to is up. It's easy in the Cave, but harder in the Forest and Plains. I will probably have to rely on my placement of tiles to express it in the landscape. From the Forest, you will be able to climb a tree to get to another room. From the Plains, I'm thinking that one of the higher platforms in a room will be a cloud that you can jump off of to get to the Cloud area. The other issue is how to show that a path between two rooms is blocked without forcing the player to go to the second room to encounter the barrier. I can either leave it as is, or force the player to break down two barriers whenever they encounter one. Another thing to add to the list of "when polishing" tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third upgrade will probably be a Double Jump feature. The player will use it to access the Cloud area. The problem is that the character already jumps around 5x his height, so adding double-jump may break the game later. Maybe I'll change it to wall-jumping instead. The player's jump height has been nagging me for a while. Maybe I'll lower it before going too much farther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the next task on my list is to add textures to the Cavern, but just enough to cover the walls. After that, I'll fill in the code in the Rock Monster's death animation to fill in the new textures over the platforms that appear when the Rock Monster dies.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1438378929845930361/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-area-built-plains.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1438378929845930361'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1438378929845930361'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-area-built-plains.html' title='New Area Built - Plains'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5342772734810118143</id><published>2012-01-02T00:00:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2012-01-13T21:19:38.932-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>Distractions Distractions Distractions</title><content type='html'>I have successfully conquered the lure of starting other projects when I come up with really cool ideas midway through a current project. Although, that's probably because I have a really hard time actually coming up with said ideas. However, I am discovering that I love learning to use new tools. I relished the time I spent learning Oracle, PHP, and Blender. Now that I'm knee-deep in a project that I &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; want to finish, I realize that this is what usually makes me put down a project and pick up something new. I'm looking to learn Unity, UDK, Love2D (Lua), Python, Flash, C++, Ruby, and HTML5 (although that's mostly learning your way around some new Javascript libraries, and I can program Javascript in my sleep). And I just picked up the various versions of Box2D, so I really want to experiment with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I seem to have is that, once I learn to use a tool, I can't come up with a project that I'm excited about to keep me interested in using it. Maybe I'm doing this backwards. Maybe the way to go is to come up with a project that you're already excited about, then learn the tools necessary to make it a reality.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/5342772734810118143/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/distractions-distractions-distractions.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5342772734810118143'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/5342772734810118143'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2012/01/distractions-distractions-distractions.html' title='Distractions Distractions Distractions'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-2693698538605308716</id><published>2011-12-30T20:51:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.671-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Rock Monster Attacks</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;It's not perfect, but the Rock Monster is moving and killing &lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CSrzEcMr18Y/Tv5pWTibAlI/AAAAAAAAAA4/677qpllueDA/s1600/Screenshot3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CSrzEcMr18Y/Tv5pWTibAlI/AAAAAAAAAA4/677qpllueDA/s320/Screenshot3.png" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;It's hard to tell, but the Rock Monster is targeting the Player and trying to drop on top of them&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DTA1WF5IHJY/Tv5pW9ZAauI/AAAAAAAAABA/8_rZDf5LV34/s1600/Screenshot4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DTA1WF5IHJY/Tv5pW9ZAauI/AAAAAAAAABA/8_rZDf5LV34/s320/Screenshot4.png" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Dropping on the floor causes its friends to fall from the ceiling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bD5ptypzEpE/Tv5pXG0iCnI/AAAAAAAAABI/tRLHETOSy94/s1600/Screenshot5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bD5ptypzEpE/Tv5pXG0iCnI/AAAAAAAAABI/tRLHETOSy94/s320/Screenshot5.png" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;And killing it rewrites the layout of the room so that you can proceed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;So now I have a working boss fight.

I'm currently on Christmas break, so I've had a lot of free time. Unfortunately, most of that time has been spent on Team Fortress 2 (I'm trying to give it up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the Rock Monster is now functional as far as movement and the player reacting to getting squashed by it. I need to code the collision function for when Weapons hit the Rock Monster and the code for creating, updating, drawing, and checking collisions for the Rocks that will fall from the ceiling when the monster hits the floor. Once that's finished, I have to figure out how to make the room layout change once the Monster is dead so that the Player can progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably seems trivial to a lot of developers. But keep in mind that I'm self-taught and building this entire thing from scratch. I'm only really using XNA for collision detection and drawing.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3782220991072177692/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/rock-monster-moves.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3782220991072177692'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3782220991072177692'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/rock-monster-moves.html' title='Rock Monster Moves'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-5545696764876121212</id><published>2011-12-29T13:06:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.727-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Next Task: Boss Battle!!</title><content type='html'>The next task on my list is to add a Boss Battle to the Cave area. Since the encounter is in a cave, it makes sense to have the boss be a Rock Monster. The monster's behavior is going to be pretty simple. It will leap off screen and try to land on the player. The force of it landing will cause rocks to fall from the ceiling, hurting the player. The tricky part of this will be getting the room layout to change after the monster's death so that the player can progress. I didn't code to have platforms that can switch on or off or moving platforms. Oh well, this is what I'm here to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's my first attempt at a rock monster.

They both have platforms, items, and barriers to facilitate MetroidVania style level progression. I have a basic tileset implemented in the Forest. It's just the platforms for now, but I'll add embellishment later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PP6ok2_VM40/TvynS1zNPmI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/rNcZIY7R4Fk/s1600/Screenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PP6ok2_VM40/TvynS1zNPmI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/rNcZIY7R4Fk/s320/Screenshot1.png" width="311" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks a bit like grassland. I should probably mention that I'm not an artist at all and that I'm working this project by myself. I don't expect it to become huge, but I do expect it to be finished at some point. For comparison, this is what one of the Cave rooms looks like currently without textures and all the debugging turned on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0fUOz5yZfc/TvyoGGWYcWI/AAAAAAAAAAc/jz59QnK5y1E/s1600/Screenshot2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0fUOz5yZfc/TvyoGGWYcWI/AAAAAAAAAAc/jz59QnK5y1E/s320/Screenshot2.png" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So at least the Forest doesn't look terrible anymore.

Most of them have been written in Java and I would hesitate to call any of them "finished". I have discovered a two major issues with my development process.&lt;br /&gt;First, I'm unwilling to throw out and redesign big sections of code. In one of my earlier attempts at a MetroidVania games, I was finished with the engine and ready to start building levels when I realized that I needed to add a feature. I needed to add the ability for the player to receive messages on screen and not be able to move while reading them. I was unwilling to redesign my Player class to add this feature. I ended up scrapping the project and moving on.&lt;br /&gt;Second, related to the first, I end up planning too much and getting bogged down in engine coding. As you can see above, I "finished" building the engine before working on the actual game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this time! I'm keeping my mind open to the idea that my code now will look completely different when I'm finished and I'm writing new features as I need them, no matter what I have to redesign.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/4754983192911125553/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/overcoming-previous-troubles.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4754983192911125553'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/4754983192911125553'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/overcoming-previous-troubles.html' title='Overcoming Previous Troubles'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-3751975007242586483</id><published>2011-12-29T12:35:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.685-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Level Design</title><content type='html'>Seeing as how the game is going to be in the MetroidVania style, there really aren't going to be "levels". Instead, there are going to be a series of areas that are blocked off by different types of barriers, each requiring a different item or ability in order to pass them. My initial design has 10 areas: Forest, Cave, Plains, Cavern, Clouds, Ruins, Water, Mountain, Volcano, and Lair. Total, there are going to be about 60 "rooms" or "screens" for the player to navigate, 6 upgrades/items for the player to collect, as well as numerous health upgrades.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/3751975007242586483/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/level-design.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3751975007242586483'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/3751975007242586483'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/level-design.html' title='Level Design'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-1508486923172122917</id><published>2011-12-29T12:31:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T09:52:48.659-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Development'/><title type='text'>Initial Design and Story</title><content type='html'>So the first game that I'll start blogging about is my current project. I started this project a little over a month ago. It's going to be a MetroidVania style 2D Platformer. The working title for now is "Unbalanced Equation". I'm developing this using C# and XNA 4.0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic story is this: a madman has discovered a set of ancient ruins on an unexplored world. Within these ruins, he has found tools normally used to keep reality stable. Exposure to these tools, clearly not meant for humans, caused him to lose his mind and vow to unmake reality by unbalancing the equation the tools use to keep reality stable. You are a robot, part of a military force sent to stop this madman. As your fleet approaches the planet, the reality around the planet starts to break down. Your ship is the only one to make it through the turbulence. So it is up to you to make your way down to the innermost chamber of the ruins to stop this madman. Along the way, you will have to deal with the local flaura and fauna, as well as the effects of reality breaking down, in order to reach the madman and put a stop to him.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/1508486923172122917/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/initial-design-and-story.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1508486923172122917'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/1508486923172122917'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/initial-design-and-story.html' title='Initial Design and Story'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.post-8167237478094005341</id><published>2011-12-29T12:23:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2012-01-17T22:07:17.661-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General'/><title type='text'>First Post</title><content type='html'>So, this is me using Blogger. I'm JoeDono, a web developer. But that's not why we're here. I'm also an independent video game programmer. I've heard that a lot of developers keep a development diary. They do this for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In case their game gets famous and other developers want to see how it's done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To keep track of their own progress so they can see how far they've come&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;So this is me starting my development diary. I chose Blogger mostly because it's Google. I already use a good number of their tools, and I trust that they're not evil.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://littlehive.blogspot.com/feeds/8167237478094005341/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/first-post.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8167237478094005341'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/7919077879461741892/posts/default/8167237478094005341'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://littlehive.blogspot.com/2011/12/first-post.html' title='First Post'/><author><name>JoeDono</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/13830611405683199935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7919077879461741892.page-2904582458370988571</id><published>2014-04-22T15:25:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2014-04-22T15:25:50.426-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#page'/><title type='text'>Projects</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: left;

There was also an artist initially, but we grew apart and lost contact over the years. So it's mainly just me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started making games in 2006 using GameMaker 7.0. I was already interested in computers and programming. What else is a young college kid going to do for private programming practice when he has lots of free time and not a whole lot of problems? After building a quick game or two, I realized that sticking with GameMaker would limit me to a hobbyist. The Computer Science major at my school used Java to teach the major aspects of programming, so I dug around and found &lt;a href="http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/%7Ead/jg/"&gt;Killer Game Programming in Java&lt;/a&gt;, which got me started on actual game development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a decent web development job soon after graduating and my skills got a jumpstart with all the practice I got in a professional environment. Sadly, the job soon devolved into a routine of maintenance and I had more spare time. So, I started building games again to fill the time. I followed what I called the "Cloning Path to Game Building." You use the skills you have to clone various classic games of increasing complexity in order to increase said skills: Pong, Breakout, Tetris, Pac-Man, and Mario Bros. I made it as far as Pac-Man before my own ideas started to take shape. All my games were free and most were built by just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the later years of this time period, I started exploring the potential of other languages and libraries: Python/PyGame, Lua/Love2D, ZGameEditor, Sphere2D, Actionscript/Flixel, C++/HGE, Unity3D, Source. I had to learn it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I got sick of the feeling like I was wasting my time and I changed jobs. Privately, I started exploring other languages outside of Java. The obvious choice was C#. It was the most similar to Java and, based on the industry news I was reading, had become the industry standard for pretty much all kinds of Web and Windows Application development. So, I found an XNA tutorial book to get me started, and I haven't looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behind the Name: Little HIVE Studios&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a freshman in college, there was a group of older students I hung out with. They called themselves "The Hive" and were a group of the most interesting people on campus (at least, I thought so). I had a group of friends who were closer to my age that kind of broke off from the original HIVE. When it came time to come up with a studio name, I choose "Little HIVE" as an homage to the group that made me a more interesting person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behind the Name: JoeDono&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, when I was a freshman in college, I joined the school's Anime Club. One week, we started watching the first season of Shaman King. In this series, the main character is a shaman named Yoh who summons a samurai from ancient legend to be his guardian spirit. As most actual samurais did, this one called his master by the honorific "-dono," which basically means "Lord." My actual name is Joe, so applying the main character's moniker of "Yoh-Dono" to me wasn't that big of a stretch. The name stuck. It actually got to the point where people thought that "Dono" was actually my real last name.

Don&amp;#39;t schedule anything for the weekend of the game jam!&lt;br /&gt;2. Know your development environment inside and out! (Making a practice game is great for this)&lt;br /&gt;3. Simplify your game concept until it&amp;#39;s as basic as possible, especially since this is your first time.&lt;br /&gt;4. Focus on making a complete game, often times completeness is more important than quality.&lt;br /&gt;5.
