Happy Easter everyone! Despite the holiday, not a whole lot happened today. I managed to go to the Easter mass at the church next to school. It was really crowded, to the point that there wasn't even enough room for people to stand in the church and spilled outside. It was all in English and, as expected, quite a bit of the people were foreigners.

I met up with Jen, David, and Ryan (two guys from my dorm) and we went on a tour of Shinjuku. None of them had been there before. We found quite the Disney Store. Three floors of mugs, pillows, and figures and an entrance guaranteed to catch your eye (as seen in the picture). Afterward, we toured Shibuya, another place I had already been. Jen was looking for a Hyakuen Store (dollar store), but Shibuya is too high-end to have one.

That's pretty much it. It seems that not everyone on my list is getting these emails. Probably because I'm using an abandoned account. So, can I ask that everyone reply to this one just to let me know that you're getting these (even if you've replied to a previous email). Also, I'll probably be changing my email address soon. I gave this address to the clubs at school that had mailing lists that I was interested in, but it seems that their systems and yahoo don't handshake very well. I've now gotten 2 emails that have no subject and no body, just a 90 line sender name (in Japanese). It throws Yahoo for a loop. I'll let everyone know when I'm changing it. The photobucket site won't change though.

Course registration is tom. Pray that I don't hit too much trouble.
