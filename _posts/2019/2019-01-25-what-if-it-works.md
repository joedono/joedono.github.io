title: What if it Works?

I just found one of those wholesome Tumblr reposts. It said that someone's therapist taught them to interrupt their anxious thinking by asking "What if this all works out?" I got that epiphany feeling when I read that. It struck a chord with me. I have a lot of anxious thoughts. I've probably mentioned a lot previously that I get really anxious trying to predict how conversations and interactions will go so I'll be prepared for the worst case scenario. The problem is usually that I'll get so bogged down thinking about the negatives and waste time when the real situation turns out much better than that.

So I'm going to give this a try. I'm already getting sort of good with interrupting my instinctual "I hate the world" thinking with something more positive, this seems like a good next step. If I catch myself imagining or assuming the worst, I'm going to try to let myself only go down that road once, and then try to imagine how it could go better. What could happen if it does work out or if my hard work pays off. I might get burned, but I think I'll be a lot happier. And things actually **have** been working out for me lately. So I'm going to try this and see if it'll affect my life in a good way.
