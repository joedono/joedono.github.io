title: "Rock Monster Moves"

It's the end of the first day since I've started this blog. I'm currently on Christmas break, so I've had a lot of free time. Unfortunately, most of that time has been spent on Team Fortress 2 (I'm trying to give it up).

Anyway, the Rock Monster is now functional as far as movement and the player reacting to getting squashed by it. I need to code the collision function for when Weapons hit the Rock Monster and the code for creating, updating, drawing, and checking collisions for the Rocks that will fall from the ceiling when the monster hits the floor. Once that's finished, I have to figure out how to make the room layout change once the Monster is dead so that the Player can progress.

This probably seems trivial to a lot of developers. But keep in mind that I'm self-taught and building this entire thing from scratch. I'm only really using XNA for collision detection and drawing.
