I've just had my first character death in D&D!! What a big checkbox that was on my life list.

I suppose it was technically my third, but it was the first that happened during "normal" gameplay. The others were when the party went off the rails of the campaign and when the campaign was overpowered and unbalanced.

So now that Mark has died, I have to come up with a new character. I really want to keep the paladin half-orc. Maybe it'll just be Mark's slightly more intelligent brother, who is considerably more in shape due to actually working while Mark was reading. He probably left in search of Mark after he left. So he'll also be a paladin who was always a little curious about all those books he was reading, but kept having more important things to do, like working the farm.

So he'll be another half-orc paladin who is sort of searching for adventure, and for Mark. What's his name going to be?

I floated the idea of Jeff, but I think I'll make it a little more serious. Ori and the Will of the Wisps has a couple cool characters in it. Grom and Kwolok sound pretty good. Grom Ordun sounds nice.
