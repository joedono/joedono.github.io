I'm actually writing from home for this one, because I can't wait until tomorrow to work out my feelings.

I'm a member of a guild in FFXIV made up of people I know. I hesitate to call them friends, but I'm hoping that will eventually change as I keep playing with them. The issue I'm wrestling with is that the guild leadership doesn't seem to care at all about the game. They picked an incredibly annoying song for the FC house and refuse to let anyone change it, they've been holding out on gardening at the house and have been dragging their feet with granting anyone else permission to use it, and they're never online. I'm getting lonely...

The thing keeping me here is that my wife, one good friend, and two people I'm trying to be better friends with are also in the guild.

I dunno. My wife is getting sick of my complaining. One of the prospective friends actually left to join her old guild now that whatever drama that made her leave has been resolved, and we're still playing with her. She hasn't been kicked off of the discord server yet. I don't know the leadership very well, or at all. They make me uncomfortable, but I can't put my finger on why. Maybe that's part of my problem. I was about to make the claim that they're unresponsive on social media, but I haven't tried to reach out to them at all. I'm terrified of annoying them and coming across as someone who only cares about the game.

That's what it is then. Now I can deal with it better.
