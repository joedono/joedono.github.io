Today, I had my first religion class (Philosophical approaches to Buddhism). It was okay. The material is pretty interesting, we're going to have to translate an ancient Chinese manuscript. The only issue is that the teacher has a hypnotist's voice. I could only listen for about 10 minutes before I started falling asleep. It might also be because I'm tired from all the adjusting. I don't know if I'm going to stick with this class or exchange it for something else. Exchanging would mean that I have to email Fairfield and get their approval, talk to the dean of foreign students and get his approval, pick a new course, get that teacher's approval, and finally get my old teacher's approval. It seems like it's more trouble than it's worth, but I might regret not doing it later.

I went to the Ballroom Dance welcoming party tonight (hence the late report). A lot of nice people, and a whole bunch of new members, most of who are Japanese. It was quite a fun time. Practice starts next Monday night. They'll probably have to special order dance shoes for me. It was incredibly surprising when I found out none of them know swing. How can you have a ballroom dance club and not do swing!? Once they all found out that I and another female foreigner had experience, they all said "Please teach us." This is going to be interesting.

I found the judo club, but they meet at the same time as ballroom twice a week, except they also meet everyday. It might be fun. I'll have to check it out first.

Tomorrow I begin my hunt for Yuta and the other firespinners. There's a train station that drops me off on the doorstep to their meeting place (which is a park). I only know a general location and summer weekends. I don't know if they consider this summer or not, or what time they meet. So this'll be a waiting game, but I know it'll all be worth it.

Tomorrow morning is break time. I already finished all my homework for the weekend, so just a bit of time for review and I'll be set for Monday. Tonight, I go to bed with my first immersion headache. It's a headache that comes from thinking too hard for too long, typically brought on by continuous translating.

Now I'm going to go introduce someone to the wonder that is Fate/Stay Night. See you tomorrow.
