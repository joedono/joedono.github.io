Today, I went to see an anime detective movie with Jen. The movie was entirely in Japanese (no subtitles) and I was very proud of myself for understanding around 60% of what they were saying. The theater itself was incredible. The backs of the seats fit even my height and were padded. It was cool.

Tomorrow KODOKAN!!! But I still have to find the darn place as well as plan on doing homework for the rest of the day. I have a 300 word essay to write for Monday (not bad by itself) start research on a project involving Christianity's effect on China, and study for a Japanese lesson quiz. I still don't regret changing my schedule though. Expect either a huge amount of pictures tomorrow, or a moping email talking about how I couldn't find it in time.
