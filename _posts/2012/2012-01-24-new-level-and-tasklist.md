title: "New Level and TaskList"

So Level 3 of 5 has been built. I still have to playtest it and add enemies, but it's slapped into the levels.dat file. Since the levels themselves are just splotches of ink, I'm not going to bother posting screenshots unless I actually have some new graphical things to post. Here's a dump of what remains on my ToDo list:
* Re-draw the Enemy Sprite. Ghosts are fine for placeholders, but I'm thinking something more detailed. Like Polar Bears.
* Build Level 4
* Build Level 5
* Draw Player Death animations
* Build in Game Over or "After Death" functions. My levels are getting kind of big, so I'll probably add checkpoints to them.
* Add "winding up" code to the enemy. Currently, the enemies chase the player immediately after they get inked. It will probably work better if the player has an "OHMYGODOHMYGOD" moment before the monster starts chasing them.
* Make hazards and enemies display when they kill the player. I foresee a lot of "HOW...WHAT...WHAT JUST KILLED ME??" frustration if I don't put this functionality in.
* Add game winning code/credits
* Add ability for player to configure the controls
* Experiment with making the player bigger
