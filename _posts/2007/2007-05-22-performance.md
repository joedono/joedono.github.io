So I just found out two things yesterday, one very good and the other very bad (in a non-life-shattering kind of way, more of a blow to my interests).

First, the good thing. I was told that, sometime in June, the other newbies and I in the ballroom club, are going to put on a performance for the rest of the club and their friends. We have a set routine to memorize, but it's only about a minute long, and it's all basic stuff. They're still neglecting to tell us how to lead, and I'm concerned about what the club is going to do for the rest of June and July if the performance is that soon. We'll either disband (worst case), keep meeting but on a more fun basis, or just party wild and be social. I'll try and snag some pictures, but no promises.

Now the bad thing. First, if you don't know what Touhou is, read this article: http://www.pooshlmer.com/touhouwiki/index.php/Imperishable_Night:_Gameplay Now, know that the ONE (I repeat...ONE) person who makes these games manages to make a new one every year. This year's is in the making, but he released a demo on Sunday and he was distributing it at a convention that I would have really wanted to go to. It was being held at the Sunshine City building in Tokyo, which I know the general location of. But I didn't know about it! I really wanted to go! I did pick up a free demo online though, and there wasn't much else on display, based on what I've read. But I still would've liked to meet the maker.

Classes have either picked up the pace, or just switched around stuff. Japanese was hit the hardest because we have it everyday, so we missed 5 classes. They solved this by taking out all the review days, which I didn't know we had in the first place. That just means more studying. The rest of my classes were "teach as you go" type classes, where the teacher makes up the schedule as he goes along, so they won't have any problem adjusting the class schedule accordingly. I do have three Japanese tests this week, the first one was this morning. Tomorrow is a lesson test, and the next is a vocab test for the next chapter. It's getting really confusing because we're moving at a different pace through the three books we have. We'll have a test on chapter 7 in one book on one day, and the next day we'll have a chapter 10 test in a different book. It's really confusing.

I know that we got to gloat about seeing Spiderman before you did, but now we have to wait until Friday for Pirates of the Carribbean, which I am of course going to see. Probably in the same theater.

Oh wow, it's 1:00am and I have a lesson test tomorrow. Good night everyone.
