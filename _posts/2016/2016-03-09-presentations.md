I've been really bored lately, waiting for my next big project to start up, so I finally buckled down and started working on my first Reveal Presentation. A guide to being a Warrior in FFXIV. I think I'm squeezing too much information into this presentation, but I've written this guide before on a forum and lost it when the forum closed. :sadface: Now I'll have my own copy that I can forward around or just look at whenever I feel like it.

So far, Reveal is a decent engine. I'm writing all the slides by hand though, so it's kind of tedious. Maybe their online presentation builder would make this easier. Although looking at it, it looks like you can't download the presentation after you create it. Although that's no obstacle, since it's all HTML anyway. It does require you to sign up with an account, so I'll probably stick with writing the presentation manually.

Right now, I'm just concentrating on getting all the information I want on the page. Once that's done _then_ I'll work on paring it down and making the presentation friendlier.

So what else is new? Work has been hectic today. Lots of things breaking and no one being sure whether this issue is because this thing broke or that thing broke. I'm done with all of my work for the remainder of my allotted time on this project. My new project should start up before any new work comes my way. I can't decide whether I'm looking forward to the new project or not. On the one hand, it's probably going to be the most interesting work I've gotten in the past 2 years. On the other, my team is made up entirely of overseas contractors. It's not the first time I've worked with contractors, but I've never worked closely with someone off-site before. Well, that's not true. But I've definitely never worked with closely with someone off-site and in a different timezone before, much less in another country. I hope this goes well.
