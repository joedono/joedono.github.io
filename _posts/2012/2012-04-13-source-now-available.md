As promised, it has been over a month since my last entry. My new job has me pretty busy, which is the exact reason I left my old job. I had enough spare time at my old job that I was able to build a dozen games and 5 websites. I was done learning at my old job. Now I'm working with all sorts of technologies I've never been exposed to. Yay me!!

But that's not why you come here. And I have a game dev update for you guys too. I've uploaded the source code of The Great Inkscape to my project page. It's available in the downloads section of the project page. Knock yourselves out!
