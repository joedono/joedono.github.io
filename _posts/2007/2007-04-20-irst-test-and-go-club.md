Well, I pretty much aced the first Japanese chapter test this morning. I was also extremely happy that it was my only class of the day. I successfully changed my religion class from the one centered on philosophy to the one centered on history and anthropology. It'll still fulfill my religion requirement at Fairfield either way.

Afterward, Jen and I went looking for a movie theater in Shinjuku because the Detective Conan movie was supposed to come out today. We managed to find a theater and squeezed out that the movie actually comes out tomorrow (please don't disown her, Kevin! lol). So, struck with the disappointment of that, we ate at a McDonald's and called it a day.

I spent the day on laundry and napping. It was pretty sunny today, but my clothes still didn't get entirely dry. Don't worry, it's less then half my clothing that needed washing.

Tonight was when the real fun started. I went to the Go Club welcoming party in Shinjuku. This is Go:

They took us out for Yakiniku, which is where you are served a plate full of meat raw, and you cook it yourself on the grill provided on the table. It was quite cool, especially when I discovered that some of the oils in the meat were quite flammable *evil laugh*. But it was delicious and I got in quite a bit of Japanese practice.

Afterward, the party divided into two groups. One went to Karaoke, and the other went drinking. I went with the latter groups, but only had two glasses of sake (or nihonshu, as I learned it's called here). This was, by far, the most sociable club I had visited. I spent most of the time talking to a female member named Mayumi. It turns out that she wants to study in America but she's having a lot of trouble with the English Proficiency test, especially in the speaking section. So, she asked for my help (and even called me sensei). It was incredibly entertaining, using my broken Japanese to try and teach this girl English. It was also the best practice I've had yet and I'm probably going to go to bed with my second Immersion Headache.

We ended up losing track of time a bit and got back 15 minutes past curfew, but we had called the manager when we were at the station in Shinjuku and said we would be a little late, so he accepted our apology happily and that was the end of it.

I'm soooooooooooooooo glad tomorrow's Saturday.
