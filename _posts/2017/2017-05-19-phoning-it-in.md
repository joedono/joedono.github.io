I think I'm about done with Hive Weather. CSS animations were really not meant for what I want to do here. I followed a few tutorials, and about all I learned was how to make some pretty cool looking loading icons. You have to code the keyframes by hand, and you have to know so much more about CSS properties than I do in order to get the effect you want. I'm already not that great of an artists as is, but this is asking me to work with a smaller toolset than ever. I'll probably still go back through the tutorials a little more, they'll help me with some of my other projects, but I'm calling Hive Weather pretty much done for now. How many places are going to have "Sand" as their weather anyway?

Either way, it was pretty enjoyable consuming an external API so I didn't have to do any of that work. Even though that's where most of my work has been over the years of my career. I suppose it's where I'm normally most comfortable. Just grabbing and manipulating data without too much regard for how it's shown to the user. Now I just need another idea for a pretty site to build.
