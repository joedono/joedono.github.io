In case you haven't heard. A huge earthquake rocked Japan this morning. I want you all to know that it hit the southern coast of Japan. We only got minor shaking. So I am still safe and sound and totally not looking forward to finals.

Also, since our trip to Mt. Fuji was cancelled because of the typhoon, we decided to reschedule. We're going tomorrow night and we're going to try and make it to the top. Wish us luck!
