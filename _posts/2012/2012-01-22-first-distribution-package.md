I realize this isn't something I should be excited about. It's not like I sent my program to the moon or anything. But come on! Remember the feeling you got the first time you hit "Run" on your first "Hello World" program? It was a great feeling. And I'm feeling it right now. I've just taken the alpha build of The Great Inkscape, and made an executable (.exe) out of it!! I can take this folder, and actually give it to other people without worrying that they need to download and install Python and PyGame, hoping that they get the correct versions, and have any other required files that I don't know about. This. Is. AWESOME!!
