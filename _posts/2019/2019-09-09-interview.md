Holy f**k!! This was a pretty incredible weekend for Weave for me!!

I had a friend over yesterday who I hadn't seen in years. He's reasonable active in the online game streaming community, to the point where he's thinking about pushing his group to game a little later in the night so they can draw the European and Australian crowd. He's always looking for new material. At some point, I pitched Weave to him, mostly just so he'd know what I was interested in. He immediately started evaluating the streaming potential of the game (which of course is immense) and wanted to play a game with him as his girlfriend. I was only planning on showing them how it worked, but that turned into them creating accounts on the spot, going through character creation, and an impromptu game in Cherry Blossom.

They loved it!! I had no idea my friend had gotten into tabletop gaming as much as I had. I took them through an anime-on-the-beach adventure where they got attacked by a mutated demon that was the victim of experiments in extreme plant growth by the magical scientist Yveas (which we decided to pronounce "Easies"). They did admirably with their capabilities and a few choice items from me. They had a ton of ridiculous fun and he invited me to come to their streams and maybe run a game. I might just take them up on it at some point, once I message him and figure out what their streaming schedule is like. Not that I won't have any lack of free time in the coming weekends, with my wife off at faire every weekend.

Then I had a first. Last night I actually got online with my Discord group and finished the two-parter in my Iron & Salt playset. They were storming the office building of a corporation invested in green energy that was actually run by aliens experimenting with the local "fauna" (meaning wyverns and demons). Lucifer contracted the group to take them down, and we had an amazing showdown in the top office suite of the building, fighting against the aliens and a fungus demon. Lucifer got called in and "killed" and everyone got to do something. It felt amazing!!

And to top it all off, the marketing and social media manager at Monocle Society wants to interview me about my playset this evening!! She framed it as wanting to make sure the company was ready to release the playset creator and the "store." The mention of a "store" has me intrigued. I never had any illusions about making money off of this playset, but that might just be a possibility. I'm just thrilled to be talking about it with someone. Everyone I've played it with and everyone I've loaned it to say they have an absolute blast playing it.

I just got a great idea! I was to run a series of games once the playset creator is out and I finish updating my playset. I'll run 4 sessions, one every Saturday for a month. I'll have a signup form, and run a bunch of monster hunting games for everyone!

I'm going to be so burnt out by the end of that... but it'll be so worth it.
