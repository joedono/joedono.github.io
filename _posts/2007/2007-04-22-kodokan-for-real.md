Well, I did it. I went to a tournament at the Kodokan. I didn't compete though, and I slept in just enough to see our team get it's third loss that pretty much put them out of the tournament. They left soon after, so I didn't get a team picture. But I got plenty of other pictures. I also figured out how to take continuous photos and video with my camera.

So, now that I've found out that my digital camera actually makes a pretty good video camera, I've started experimenting with uploading videos to the web. This is my first attempt, and it didn't go so well. The video is just over 5 minutes long, and it's just me talking. But it's over 200MB!!!! How in the world does that work!? I have several 20 minute videos and none of them amount to more than 170MB. A 5 minute video should be nothing! I'm trying to reduce the size, but all I have at the moment is Windows Movie Maker (which stinks, get something else) and I don't have time for another go at this tonight, but for those of you with broadband (or a willingness to overnight download a 5 minute video) enjoy the video. For the rest of you, I'll try and reduce the size and upload another one in the morning (tonight for you).
