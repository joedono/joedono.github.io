It's only been one day since I decided on an idea for this month's project. I think it's due to the familiar toolset. I'm also hitting up <a href="http://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt</a> for my art assets this time around. The selecting is okay. I'll definitely have to settle and have a bunch of things that don't go together.

Eh? Eh? Not too shabby for someone with absolutely zero art talent, right? I think this is going to be a pretty good month.</div>
