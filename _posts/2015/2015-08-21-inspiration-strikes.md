I think it's about to happen again. I have been hearing rumblings on Reddit about some user nicknamed "Asset Jesus." I had also seen the occasional thread in /r/gamedev promising free assets by the hundreds. I didn't really think much of it. Then earlier this week, I replayed an old GameMaker game called [The Power](http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/33982-the-power). The same thing happened to me the last time I played it too. I realized that the game is heavily stylized to make programmer art look good. Then it inspired me to try making my own MetroidVania style game.

So, that's what I'm going to try doing. I had tried it before, but my vision wasn't clear enough. I'm deciding early on that I don't care if there's nothing unique about this game. I'll put together a slightly generic list of progression items and a map of the area, maybe a few bosses, and I'll get to work. When I thought about what has stopped me in the past, I realized that I would lose motivation when there was no art to put in. So, I'm going to use stuff put out by this Asset Jesus. Turns out he has his own small company and a big website full of free assets: [Kenney NL](http://kenney.nl/).

Maybe this will turn into something. Maybe it won't. It'll give me something new to tinker with. The great thing about Kenney is that I think he has enough assets to make a complete game and they're all the same style. When I've tried searching for assets, I've usually ended up giving up because I understand that nothing goes with anything else. I'll get a dungeon tileset that looks good, then I'll get a character that looks good, but they'll look terrible together. Even worse then my go-to blue circle character. At least the style on all of these assets is consistant.

Now let's just hope that I actually finish this one.
