This is my first attempt posting to this blog from my phone. I downloaded and tried a few different github and code managers for phones before settling for Github's plain desktop site. End their mobile site doesn't include actual code management. I can view the code and probably manage the wiki and issues (if I cared about them), but not the actual codebase. Oh well, here I am anyway.

Today we're celebrating my father's birthday. We just got back from white water rafting. I'm incredibly sore and I'm supposed to put on a show to round out the night. I'm currently laying on the couch, trying to ignore my aching back. I'm not looking forward to standing up. At least no one is asking me to help with anything. I'm only a little guilty. I had a big day yesterday. I just hope I can put on a good show. Our neighbors have been looking forward to this all year. I'll take some more painkillers and hopefully be alright. At least we don't have to go back to work until Tuesday.

I'm honestly not sure what we'll be doing tomorrow. Everyone else is leaving to go to work on Monday. Guess we'll just spend the day relaxing, unless my wife wants to do something.

Of course I'm looking forward to getting back to raiding. I'm going to be a little behind the rest of my group for the next few weeks. But after grinding my heart out during those first months, I just don't see the point in rushing things. I'll get everything to 60 eventually. I've already got the important things up there. I'm pretty sure they won't be raising the level cap again in the near future. Whee...grinding.
