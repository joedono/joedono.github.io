title: Pain Sucks

Pain sucks. It sucks a lot. It sucks even more when it sneaks up on you and you've layered and layered all these activities that do nothing but aggravate it.

I went jet-skiing on Friday. It was the first time I had been out since I was a teenager. I overbalanced and got thrown off while going 35mph. I didn't realize it at the time, but I apparently sprained every joint in my right arm at the time. I got back on and wiped out twice more before calling it quits. Then I went out kayaking, still without noticing anything was wrong. I got back, felt a little stuff, but chalked it up to just the level of activity from the day. The next day, however... I woke up in extreme amounts of pain. I couldn't raise my head without pinching something in my back and my entire right arm was sore. BUT, we had scheduled white-water rafting for that day, and there was no way I was going to miss out on that. Unfortunately, I did the dumb thing and let myself be put on the right side of the raft. I did all the rowing with my sore arm. That just aggravated everything further. I spent the entire next day moaning and groaning on the couch, wishing I could be doing anything else.

Now, it's been 5 days since the initial accident, and I still cannot raise my head. My arm aches. I've had to stay home from work today and probably will have to tomorrow as well. I'm going to take at least 8 hot showers today and the max recommended dosage of Tylenol. Maybe then I won't be completely miserable for the entire day. At least my workload is light.
