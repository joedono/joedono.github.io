I've been working on honing the other half of my programming skills: Web Development. All the websites I've built so far have been from scratch, and one where I used an MVC framework. For one of my latest projects, I'm giving WordPress a shot. I gotta say, if your website just showcases content, WordPress is the way to go. It doesn't have much support for custom databases. If you need custom data stored in a database, you might as well just code the site yourself. That being said, there isn't a whole lot that WordPress CAN'T do.

The biggest hurdle I found is that, since a lot of the plug-ins and themes are community built, there isn't a lot of compatibility between them. I tried adding a progress bar widget to my site, then I changed the theme, and the widget started malfunctioning. I put together a header menu and added some drop-down entries to it. It worked fine in the default Twenty-Eleven theme, but as soon as I switched to a different theme, the drop-down sections were displayed as top-level entries.

So the lesson here is this: working with a CMS like WordPress is great. It handles a ton of the commonly requested features for websites. The downside is that you have to deal with the CMS's interface and what has available. You have to learn how to get its toolset to do what you want it to, which is a little harder than it sounds.

If you're just looking for blogging or new feeds, then it's definitely something for you. I may end up converting this blog to a custom hosted wordpress blog. That is, if I ever find another use for this site other than blogging. That will probably happen at the same time that I come up with a better name than Little HIVE.
