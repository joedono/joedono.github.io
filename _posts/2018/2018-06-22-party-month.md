Things have gotten better since my last post. I attribute a lot of that to my wife getting a personal trainer, making more time to go figure skating, quitting smoking, and just in general taking excellent care of herself. She's figured out the random little pains that we thought might indicate something more serious.

It might seem weird that this is the case, but I think I posted about this article my wife sent me a while ago where a person with good social graces would never complain about the quality of their life or health to someone close to them who has a lower quality of life or health. Since my wife is pretty much my only outlet for venting about my life and health, I've had to keep it all to myself and was unable to seek support. I don't think I really needed the support, but I do think I needed the support to be available. I've also re-downloaded the meal-tracker app I used a long time ago. Maybe that'll be the next step in my own fitness routine. I'm pretty set in working out on my own three times a week for about 30 minutes. I've noticed little changes, but none where I'd like them to be. I also don't really know what I should be watching for. I'm starting to feel like I need to put more weight on the bars to get a good workout, so I guess that's a good sign.

In any case, we have a real busy plan for the next...4 weekends or so. Parties and get-togethers every weekend from now until mid-July. Should be a really fun time.
