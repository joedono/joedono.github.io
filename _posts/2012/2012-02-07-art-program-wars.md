When it comes to art programs, it really doesn't get much better or all-inclusive than Photoshop. It has everything an artist could need, including a high price tag. As a rather frugal indie developer, I tend to like my programs as free as possible. I do my development in Notepad++ or PyScripter and all my programming libraries are free and open source. Historically, I've gone with GIMP. It is (sort of) similar to Photoshop and is open source. I am not an artist by any means, but my needs are a little too great for MS Paint.

Besides GIMP, one of the other freeware graphics program that indie game developers use for their 2D art is Inkscape. Inkscape is a vector graphics program. That means that, instead of tracking individual pixels in an image, Inkscape stores formulas and equations for every line you draw and every shape you put into the image. So that, when you scale vector images, they never get that grainy pixelated look. They are always smooth.

It may be because I've used GIMP for so long, but I just could not get a handle on how Inkscape does things. It took me all afternoon just to follow the first tutorial that has you draw the Greek flag, which should be dead simple. GIMP may be overly complicated for my needs, but I know how it works and I can get it to do what I want more often than not. So try Inkscape, but only if you're not already entrenched with another graphics program.
