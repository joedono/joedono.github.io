I found a cool library on [Bleech.IO](http://bleech.io/) for [Responsive Sidebar Navigation](https://codyhouse.co/demo/responsive-sidebar-navigation/index.html) that I think I'm going to use on my other projects. I inheritted this project this past year and I have big plans for it. I'm spending this year going through and cleaning up a lot of the technical debt that it has gained. Next year will be overhauling the UI, with the primary goal of making the site usable on mobile and the secondary goal of consolidating pages and brining important operations (like buying a ticket) to the front. Hopefully, this will stem a lot of the complaints we've been getting about how hard it is to find information about the convention.

I've had a lot of fun the past few days trying to come up with a good design for the navigation and figuring out how to make it work with what I already put together. Made me feel like a developer again and even that I've come some small distance as a designer, even if I'm just appropriating someone else's design. I wrote my first media query and even did some troubleshooting on CSS animations. Now I just have to learn how to write fully responsive pages from scratch. Being forced to do what little I did definitely helped me understand how Bootstrap is put together and now I'll have a better time integrating it with other libraries.

Hooray for having my own design sandbox!!

In other news, I did some properties-checking, and this entire blog pre-jekyll compilation clocks in at around 6MB, which is a little bigger than I thought it would be. Most of that is from the Cool Stuff lib folder, which is around 4MB by itself. The rest is mostly the Bootstrap font files, which I could probably reference externally. Although it is pretty cool that I can put all this cool stuff together, and be smaller than the LÃ–VE library.
