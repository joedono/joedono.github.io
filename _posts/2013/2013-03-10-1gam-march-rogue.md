Hooray! New project!! After the past two months participating in <a href="http://onegameamonth.com/">OneGameAMonth</a>, I'm riding high. Well, I wasn't really. The ideas for January and February came so easily. First there was Global Game Jam, which just naturally gets the creative juices flowing, then I just took the idea I originally had for Global Game Jam and worked on that for February.

Then...I was back at square 1, without an original idea to carry me through March. So, I cheated. Normally, when I'm faced with a length of time that I want to spend honing my game development skills and I don't have an idea for a project, I'll clone classic Atari games from when I was a kid. I've already done the big ones: Pong, Space Invaders, Breakout, Pac-man, and Mastermind. Then I did one that <b>I</b> liked: Haunted House (which was recently remade and is now available on Steam, I might add). So I went back through my catalog of old Atari games to see if anything stuck out.

Then, McFunkyPants announced the theme for this month: Rogue. While it is an extremely broad concept, I immediately thought of <a href="http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=682">Dark Chambers</a> for the Atari 7800. Dark Chambers is an early version of Gauntlet. I traced back its history a little and found that the maker of Dark Chambers built an earlier version that later inspired the makers of the original Gauntlet, effectively making Dark Chambers for the 7800 Gauntlet's less famous little brother.

I decided to remake Dark Chambers and started on this month's project:

I'm using <a href="http://love2d.org/">Love2D</a> for this one. I'm not all that happy with it. Maybe it's because I have more experience with more complex object-oriented languages. Lua's table structure makes it a little difficult to get much done. Plus, I'm using a normal text editor to write it instead of an IDE, and I'm really missing the code completion. Oh well. At least I'll be able to say that I tried it and managed to finish a game with it. The facts that I will be able to publish to multiple platforms pretty easily and that the entire library is extremely tiny may make me swing back to it for a future project.

I actually am putting a decent amount of time into the art for this one. I found this video series on youtube of this guy recording time lapses of himself remastering screens from classic video games. Here's his entry from Contra: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya1KqQSkXAA">Contra - Energy Zone Boss Remastered</a>. It inspired me to try to learn my toolset a little better. This is what I ended up with:

Now I've only really done the enemy spawners (the row starting with the gravestone). But I'm really proud of that bottle.

I've gotten to the point where my Done board is filled with more stuff than my To Do board. I keep telling myself to hurry and finish because "March is almost over." Then I look at a calendar, and March isn't almost over at all.
