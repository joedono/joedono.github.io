So, July 4th was this week, and you're all probably wondering what I did to celebrate. Well...it wasn't much. One of my friends had this bright idea that we would go to the park and read the Declaration of Independence aloud (and hopefully not be accused of publicly protesting something, we didn't). We had a lot of fun with it, reading it in protester-like voices and shouting things like "Huzzah" and "Down with the king" at random moments during the declaration.
