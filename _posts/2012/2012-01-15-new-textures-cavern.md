title: "New Textures - Cavern"

I seem to be spending a lot of time posting about new art assets. Which makes sense, seeing as how describing how I've altered the Player class to use 5 methods instead of 7 is just plain boring. People want to see content they can understand!! So here you are! Here are the screenshots of the new textures for the Cavern area. The only thing I don't like is the background color. Eventually, I will fix that so that I can make it different for every room. At the moment, it's hardcoded into the main render loop as a way to clear the screen.
